    "Description": "The gssrpc__svcauth_gssapi function in the RPC library in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.6.1 and earlier might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a zero-length RPC credential, which causes kadmind to free an uninitialized pointer during cleanup.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1323\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MIT reference\nimplementation of the Kerberos network authentication protocol suite,\nwhich may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common \nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nWei Wang discovered that the free of an uninitialised pointer in the\n    Kerberos RPC library may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nWei Wang discovered that insufficient input sanitising in the\n    Kerberos RPC library may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow in the  Kerberos\n    administration daemon may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n"
