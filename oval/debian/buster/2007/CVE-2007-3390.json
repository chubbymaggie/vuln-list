      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1322\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark\nnetwork traffic analyzer, which may lead to denial of service. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nOff-by-one overflows were discovered in the iSeries dissector.\nThe MMS and SSL dissectors could be forced into an infinite loop.\nAn off-by-one overflow was discovered in the DHCP/BOOTP dissector.\nThe oldstable distribution (sarge) is not affected by these problems.\n(In Sarge Wireshark used to be called Ethereal).\n"
