    "Description": "WordPress before 2.2.2 allows remote attackers to redirect visitors to other websites and potentially obtain sensitive information via (1) the _wp_http_referer parameter to wp-pass.php, related to the wp_get_referer function in wp-includes/functions.php; and possibly other vectors related to (2) wp-includes/pluggable.php and (3) the wp_nonce_ays function in wp-includes/functions.php.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1564\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in WordPress,\na weblog manager. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nInsufficient input sanitising allowed for remote attackers to\n    redirect visitors to external websites.\nMultiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities allowed remote\n    authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.\nSQL injection vulnerability allowed allowed remote authenticated\n    administrators to execute arbitrary SQL commands.\nWordPress allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n    (bandwidth or thread consumption) via pingback service calls with\n    a source URI that corresponds to a file with a binary content type,\n    which is downloaded even though it cannot contain usable pingback data.\nInsufficient input sanitising caused an attacker with a normal user\n    account to access the administrative interface.\n"
