    "Description": "Asterisk 1.4 before 1.4.1 and 1.2 before 1.2.16 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) by sending a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) packet without a URI and SIP-version header, which results in a NULL pointer dereference.",

The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\n\u003cq\u003eMu Security\u003c/q\u003e discovered that a NULL pointer dereference in the SIP\n    implementation could lead to denial of service.\nInria Lorraine discovered that a programming error in the SIP\n    implementation could lead to denial of service.\nIt was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference in the manager\n    interface could lead to denial of service.\nIt was discovered that a programming error in the SIP implementation\n    could lead to denial of service.\nTim Panton and Birgit Arkestein discovered that a programming error\n    in the IAX2 implementation could lead to information disclosure.\nRussell Bryant discovered that a buffer overflow in the IAX\n    implementation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nChris Clark and Zane Lackey discovered that several NULL pointer\n    dereferences in the IAX2 implementation could lead to denial of\n    service.\nWill Drewry discovered that a programming error in the Skinny\n    implementation could lead to denial of service.\n"
