The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nIt was discovered that missing input sanitising inside the ftp\n    extension permits an attacker to execute arbitrary FTP commands.\n    This requires the attacker to already have access to the FTP\n    server.\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow in the SOAP extension permits\n    the execution of arbitrary code.\nThe oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include php5.\n"
