    "Description": "Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in WordPerfect Document importer/exporter (libwpd) before 0.8.9 allow user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted WordPerfect file in which values to loop counters are not properly handled in the (1) WP3TablesGroup::_readContents and (2) WP5DefinitionGroup_DefineTablesSubGroup::WP5DefinitionGroup_DefineTablesSubGroup functions.  NOTE: the integer overflow has been split into CVE-2007-1466.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1270\nSeveral security related problems have been discovered in\nOpenOffice.org, the free office suite.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\niDefense reported several integer overflow bugs in libwpd, a\n    library for handling WordPerfect documents that is included in\n    OpenOffice.org.  Attackers are able to exploit these with\n    carefully crafted WordPerfect files that could cause an\n    application linked with libwpd to crash or possibly execute\n    arbitrary code.\nNext Generation Security discovered that the StarCalc parser in\n    OpenOffice.org contains an easily exploitable stack overflow that\n    could be used by a specially crafted document to execute\n    arbitrary code.\nIt has been reported that OpenOffice.org does not escape shell\n    meta characters and is hence vulnerable to execute arbitrary shell\n    commands via a specially crafted document after the user clicked\n    to a prepared link.\nThis updated advisory only provides packages for the upcoming etch\nrelease alias Debian GNU/Linux 4.0.\nDSA-1268\niDefense reported several integer overflow bugs in libwpd, a library\nfor handling WordPerfect documents.  Attackers were able to exploit\nthese with carefully crafted Word Perfect files that could cause an\napplication linked with libwpd to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n"
