The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nStefan Esser discovered an overflow in the object reference handling\n    code of the unserialize() function, which allows the execution of\n    arbitrary code if malformed input is passed from an application.\nStefan Esser discovered that the session handler performs\n    insufficient validation of variable name length values, which allows\n    information disclosure through a heap information leak.\nStefan Esser discovered a double free vulnerability in the\n    session_regenerate_id() function, which allows the execution of\n    arbitrary code.\nStefan Esser discovered a double free vulnerability in the session\n    management code, which allows the execution of arbitrary code.\nStefan Esser discovered that the mail() function performs\n    insufficient validation of folded mail headers, which allows mail\n    header injection.\nStefan Esser discovered that the extension to handle ZIP archives\n    performs insufficient length checks, which allows the execution of\n    arbitrary code.\nDSA-1283\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, a\nserver-side, HTML-embedded scripting language, which may lead to the\nexecution of arbitrary code.
