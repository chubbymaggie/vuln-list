    "Description": "reprepro 1.3.0 through 2.2.3 does not properly verify signatures when updating repositories, which allows remote attackers to construct and distribute an ostensibly valid Release.gpg file by signing it with an unknown key, related to the update command.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1394\nIt was discovered that reprepro, a tool to create a repository of Debian\npackages, only checks the validity of known signatures when updating\nfrom a remote site, and thus does not reject packages with only unknown\nsignatures. This allows an attacker to bypass this authentication\nmechanism.\nThe oldstable distribution (sarge) is not affected by this problem.\n"
