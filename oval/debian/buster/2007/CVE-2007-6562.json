    "Description": "Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the use of FD_SET in TCPreen before 1.4.4 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service via multiple concurrent connections, which result in overflows in the (1) SocketAddress::Connect function in libsolve/sockprot.cpp and (2) monitor_bridge function in src/bridge.cpp.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1443\n\nIt was discovered that several buffer overflows in tcpreen, a tool for\nmonitoring a TCP connection, may lead to denial of service.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain tcpreen.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.3-0.1etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 1.4.3-0.3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your tcpreen package.\n\n"
