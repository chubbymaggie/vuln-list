    "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in nmbd in Samba 3.0.0 through 3.0.26a, when configured as a Primary or Backup Domain controller, allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via crafted GETDC mailslot requests, related to handling of GETDC logon server requests.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1409\nThis update fixes all currently known regressions introduced with\nthe previous two revisions of DSA-1409.\nThe original text is reproduced below:\nSeveral local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in samba,\na LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix. The Common \nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nAlin Rad Pop of Secunia Research discovered that nmbd did not properly\n   check the length of netbios packets. When samba is configured as a WINS\n   server, a remote attacker could send multiple crafted requests resulting\n   in the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.\nSamba developers discovered that nmbd could be made to overrun a buffer\n   during the processing of GETDC logon server requests.  When samba is\n   configured as a Primary or Backup Domain Controller, a remote attacker\n   could send malicious logon requests and possibly cause a denial of\n   service.\n"
