    "Description": "The DMO_VideoDecoder_Open function in loader/dmo/DMO_VideoDecoder.c in MPlayer 1.0rc1 and earlier, as used in xine-lib, does not set the biSize before use in a memcpy, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a buffer overflow and possibly execute arbitrary code, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-1387.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1536\nSeveral local vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xine, a\nmedia player library, allowed for a denial of service or arbitrary code\nexecution, which could be exploited through viewing malicious content.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\nThe DMO_VideoDecoder_Open function does not set the biSize before use in a\n    memcpy, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a buffer overflow\n    and possibly execute arbitrary code (applies to sarge only).\nArray index error in the sdpplin_parse function allows remote RTSP servers\n    to execute arbitrary code via a large streamid SDP parameter.\nArray index vulnerability in libmpdemux/demux_audio.c might allow remote\n    attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted FLAC tag, which triggers\n    a buffer overflow (applies to etch only).\nBuffer overflow in the Matroska demuxer allows remote attackers to cause a\n    denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a Matroska\n    file with invalid frame sizes.\n"
