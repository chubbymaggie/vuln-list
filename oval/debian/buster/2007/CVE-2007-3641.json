    "Description": "archive_read_support_format_tar.c in libarchive before 2.2.4 does not properly compute the length of a certain buffer when processing a malformed pax extension header, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) PAX or (2) TAR archive that triggers a buffer overflow.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1455\nSeveral local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in libarchive1,\na single library to read/write tar, cpio, pax, zip, iso9660 archives.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\nIt was discovered that libarchive1 would miscompute the length of a buffer\n  resulting in a buffer overflow if yet another type of corruption occurred\n  in a pax extension header.\nIt was discovered that if an archive prematurely ended within a pax\n  extension header the libarchive1 library could enter an infinite loop.\nIf an archive prematurely ended within a tar header, immediately following\n  a pax extension header, libarchive1 could dereference a NULL pointer.\nThe old stable distribution (sarge), does not contain this package.\n"
