    "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in modules/demux/subtitle.c in VideoLAN VLC 0.8.6d allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long subtitle in a (1) MicroDvd, (2) SSA, and (3) Vplayer file.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1543\nLuigi Auriemma, Alin Rad Pop, R\u0026eacute;mi Denis-Courmont, Quovodis, Guido\nLandi, Felipe Manzano, Anibal Sacco and others discovered multiple\nvulnerabilities in vlc, an application for playback and streaming of\naudio and video.  In the worst case, these weaknesses permit a remote,\nunauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges\nof the user running vlc.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing eight problems:\nA buffer overflow vulnerability in subtitle handling allows an\n    attacker to execute arbitrary code through the opening of a\n    maliciously crafted MicroDVD, SSA or Vplayer file.\nA format string vulnerability in the HTTP-based remote control\n    facility of the vlc application allows a remote, unauthenticated\n    attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nInsecure argument validation allows a remote attacker to overwrite\n    arbitrary files writable by the user running vlc, if a maliciously\n    crafted M3U playlist or MP3 audio file is opened.\nHeap buffer overflows in RTSP stream and session description\n    protocol (SDP) handling allow an attacker to execute arbitrary\n    code if a maliciously crafted RTSP stream is played.\nInsufficient integer bounds checking in SDP handling allows the\n    execution of arbitrary code through a maliciously crafted SDP\n    stream ID parameter in an RTSP stream.\nInsufficient integrity checking in the MP4 demuxer allows a remote\n    attacker to overwrite arbitrary memory and execute arbitrary code\n    if a maliciously crafted MP4 file is opened.\nAn integer overflow vulnerability in MP4 handling allows a remote\n    attacker to cause a heap buffer overflow, inducing a crash and\n    possibly the execution of arbitrary code if a maliciously crafted\n    MP4 file is opened.\n"
