    "Description": "The sandbox for vim allows dangerous functions such as (1) writefile, (2) feedkeys, and (3) system, which might allow user-assisted attackers to execute shell commands and write files via modelines.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1364\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the vim editor. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nUlf HĂ¤rnhammar discovered that a format string flaw in helptags_one() from\n    src/ex_cmds.c (triggered through the \u003cq\u003ehelptags\u003c/q\u003e command) can lead to the\n    execution of arbitrary code.\nEditors often provide a way to embed editor configuration commands (aka\n    modelines) which are executed once a file is opened. Harmful commands\n    are filtered by a sandbox mechanism. It was discovered that function\n    calls to writefile(), feedkeys() and system() were not filtered, allowing\n    shell command execution with a carefully crafted file opened in vim.\nThis updated advisory repairs issues with missing files in the packages\nfor the oldstable distribution (sarge) for the alpha, mips, and mipsel\narchitectures.\n"
