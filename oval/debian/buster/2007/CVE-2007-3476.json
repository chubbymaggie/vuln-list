    "Description": "Array index error in gd_gif_in.c in the GD Graphics Library (libgd) before 2.0.35 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash and heap corruption) via large color index values in crafted image data, which results in a segmentation fault.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1613\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been identified in libgd2, a library\nfor programmatic graphics creation and manipulation.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nGrayscale PNG files containing invalid tRNS chunk CRC values\n    could cause a denial of service (crash), if a maliciously\n    crafted image is loaded into an application using libgd.\nAn array indexing error in libgd's GIF handling could induce a\n    denial of service (crash with heap corruption) if exceptionally\n    large color index values are supplied in a maliciously crafted\n    GIF image file.\nThe imagearc() and imagefilledarc() routines in libgd allow\n    an attacker in control of the parameters used to specify\n    the degrees of arc for those drawing functions to perform\n    a denial of service attack (excessive CPU consumption).\nMultiple integer overflows exist in libgd's image resizing and\n    creation routines; these weaknesses allow an attacker in control\n    of the parameters passed to those routines to induce a crash or\n    execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\n    an application or interpreter linked against libgd2.\n"
