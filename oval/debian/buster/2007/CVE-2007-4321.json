    "Description": "fail2ban 0.8 and earlier does not properly parse sshd log files, which allows remote attackers to add arbitrary hosts to the /etc/hosts.deny file and cause a denial of service by adding arbitrary IP addresses to the sshd log file, as demonstrated by logging in via ssh with a client protocol version identification containing an IP address string, a different vector than CVE-2006-6302.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1456\n\nDaniel B. Cid discovered that fail2ban, a tool to block IP addresses\nthat cause login failures, is too liberal about parsing SSH log files,\nallowing an attacker to block any IP address.\n\n\nThe old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain fail2ban.\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.7.5-2etch1.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in\nversion 0.8.0-4.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your fail2ban package.\n\n"
