      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1533\nChristian Schmid and Meder Kydyraliev (Google Security) discovered a\nnumber of vulnerabilities in exiftags, a utility for extracting EXIF\nmetadata from JPEG images. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identified the following three problems:\nInadequate EXIF property validation could lead to invalid memory\n    accesses if executed on a maliciously crafted image, potentially\n    including heap corruption and the execution of arbitrary code.\nFlawed data validation could lead to integer overflows, causing\n    other invalid memory accesses, also with the potential for memory\n    corruption or arbitrary code execution.\nCyclical EXIF image file directory (IFD) references could cause\n    a denial of service (infinite loop).\n"
