      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1446\n\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark\nnetwork traffic analyzer, which may lead to denial of service. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n    The RPL dissector could be tricked into an infinite loop.\n    \n\n    The CIP dissector could be tricked into excessive memory\n    allocation.\n    \n\nFor the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.10.10-2sarge11. (In Sarge Wireshark used to be called Ethereal).\n\n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.99.4-5.etch.2.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 0.99.7-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your wireshark packages.\n\n"
