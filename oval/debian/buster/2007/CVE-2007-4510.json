    "Description": "ClamAV before 0.91.2, as used in Kolab Server 2.0 through 2.2beta1 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via (1) a crafted RTF file, which triggers a NULL dereference in the cli_scanrtf function in libclamav/rtf.c; or (2) a crafted HTML document with a data: URI, which triggers a NULL dereference in the cli_html_normalise function in libclamav/htmlnorm.c.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1366\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Clam anti-virus\ntoolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\nIt was discovered that the RTF and RFC2397 parsers can be tricked\n    into dereferencing a NULL pointer, resulting in denial of service.\nIt was discovered that clamav-milter performs insufficient input\n    sanitising, resulting in the execution of arbitrary shell commands.\nThe oldstable distribution (sarge) is only affected by a subset of \nthe problems. An update will be provided later.\n"
