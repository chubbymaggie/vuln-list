    "Description": "usr/mgmt_ipc.c in iscsid in open-iscsi (iscsi-initiator-utils) before 2.0-865 checks the client's UID on the listening AF_LOCAL socket instead of the new connection, which allows remote attackers to access the management interface and cause a denial of service (iscsid exit or iSCSI connection loss).",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1314\nSeveral local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in\nopen-iscsi, a transport-independent iSCSI implementation. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nOlaf Kirch discovered that due to a programming error access to the\n    management interface socket was insufficiently protected, which allows\n    denial of service.\nOlaf Kirch discovered that access to a semaphore used in the logging\n    code was insufficiently protected, allowing denial of service.\nThe oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include open-iscsi.\n"
