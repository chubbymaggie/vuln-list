The included XULRunner library provides rendering\nservices for several other applications included in Debian.\nRoberto Suggi Liverani discovered that the sanitising performed by\n   ParanoidFragmentSink was incomplete.\nZach Hoffmann discovered that incorrect parsing of recursive eval()\n   calls could lead to attackers forcing acceptance of a confirmation\n   dialogue.\nCrashes in the layout engine may lead to the execution of arbitrary\n   code.\nChristian Holler discovered buffer overflows in the Javascript engine,\n   which could allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n\u003cq\u003eregenrecht\u003c/q\u003e and Igor Bukanov discovered a use-after-free error in the\n   JSON-Implementation, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nDaniel Kozlowski discovered that incorrect memory handling the web workers\n   implementation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nPeleus Uhley discovered a cross-site request forgery risk in the plugin\n   code.\nDSA-2180\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Iceape internet suite, an\nunbranded version of Seamonkey:\nRoberto Suggi Liverani discovered that the sanitising performed by\n  ParanoidFragmentSink was incomplete.\nZach Hoffmann discovered that incorrect parsing of recursive eval()\n  calls could lead to attackers forcing acceptance of a confirmation\n  dialogue.\nCrashes in the layout engine may lead to the execution of arbitrary\n  code.\nChristian Holler discovered buffer overflows in the JavaScript engine,\n  which could allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n\u003cq\u003eregenrecht\u003c/q\u003e and Igor Bukanov discovered a use-after-free error in the\n  JSON-Implementation, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nChristian Holler discovered buffer overflows in the JavaScript engine,\n  which could allow the execution of arbitrary code.\nDaniel Kozlowski discovered that incorrect memory handling the web workers\n  implementation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nPeleus Uhley discovered a cross-site request forgery risk in the plugin\n  code.\nThe oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected.
