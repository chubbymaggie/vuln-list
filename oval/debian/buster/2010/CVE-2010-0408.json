    "Description": "The ap_proxy_ajp_request function in mod_proxy_ajp.c in mod_proxy_ajp in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.15 does not properly handle certain situations in which a client sends no request body, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (backend server outage) via a crafted request, related to use of a 500 error code instead of the appropriate 400 error code.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2035\nTwo issues have been found in the Apache HTTPD web server:\nmod_proxy_ajp would return the wrong status code if it encountered an\nerror, causing a backend server to be put into an error state until the\nretry timeout expired. A remote attacker could send malicious requests\nto trigger this issue, resulting in denial of service.\nA flaw in the core subrequest process code was found, which could lead\nto a daemon crash (segfault) or disclosure of sensitive information\nif the headers of a subrequest were modified by modules such as\nmod_headers.\n"
