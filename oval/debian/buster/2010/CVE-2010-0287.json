    "Description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in the ACL Manager plugin (plugins/acl/ajax.php) in DokuWiki before 2009-12-25b allows remote attackers to list the contents of arbitrary directories via a .. (dot dot) in the ns parameter.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1976\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in dokuwiki, a standards compliant\nsimple to use wiki.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\nIt was discovered that an internal variable is not properly sanitized before\nbeing used to list directories. This can be exploited to list contents of\narbitrary directories.\nIt was discovered that the ACL Manager plugin doesn't properly check the\nadministrator permissions. This allow an attacker to introduce arbitrary ACL\nrules and thus gaining access to a closed Wiki.\nIt was discovered that the ACL Manager plugin doesn't have protections against\ncross-site request forgeries (CSRF). This can be exploited to change the\naccess control rules by tricking a logged in administrator into visiting\na malicious web site.\nThe oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by these problems.\n"
