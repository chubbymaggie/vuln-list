    "Description": "The get1 command, as used by lftpget, in LFTP before 4.0.6 does not properly validate a server-provided filename before determining the destination filename of a download, which allows remote servers to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a Content-Disposition header that suggests a crafted filename, and possibly execute arbitrary code as a consequence of writing to a dotfile in a home directory.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2085\nIt was discovered that in lftp, a command-line HTTP/FTP client, there is\nno proper validation of the filename provided by the server through the\nContent-Disposition header; attackers can use this flaw by suggesting a\nfilename they wish to overwrite on the client machine, and then possibly\nexecute arbitrary code (for instance if the attacker elects to write a\ndotfile in a home directory).\n"
