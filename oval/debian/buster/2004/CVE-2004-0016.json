The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nIn the \"calendar\" module, \"save extension\" was not enforced for\n  holiday files.  As a result, server-side php scripts may be placed\n  in directories that then could be accessed remotely and cause the\n  webserver to execute those.  This was resolved by enforcing the\n  extension \".txt\" for holiday files.\nSome SQL injection problems (non-escaping of values used in SQL\n  strings) the \"calendar\" and \"infolog\" modules.\nAdditionally, the Debian maintainer adjusted the permissions on world\nwritable directories that were accidentally created by former postinst\nduring the installation.\n"
