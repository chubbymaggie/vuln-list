      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-481\nSeveral serious problems have been discovered in the Linux kernel.\nThis update takes care of Linux 2.4.17 for the IA-64 architecture.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems that will be fixed with this update:\nA vulnerability has been discovered in the R128 DRI driver in the Linux\n    kernel which could potentially lead an attacker to gain\n    unauthorised privileges.  Alan Cox and Thomas Biege developed a\n    correction for this.\nArjan van de Ven discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the\n    ncp_lookup function for ncpfs in the Linux kernel, which could\n    lead an attacker to gain unauthorised privileges.  Petr Vandrovec\n    developed a correction for this.\nzen-parse discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the\n    ISO9660 filesystem component of Linux kernel which could be abused\n    by an attacker to gain unauthorised root access.  Sebastian\n    Krahmer and Ernie Petrides developed a correction for this.\nSolar Designer discovered an information leak in the ext3 code of\n    Linux.  In a worst case an attacker could read sensitive data such\n    as cryptographic keys which would otherwise never hit disk media.\n    Theodore Ts'o developed a correction for this.\nAndreas Kies discovered a denial of service condition in the Sound\n    Blaster driver in Linux.  He also developed a correction for this.\nThese problems are also fixed by upstream in Linux 2.4.26 and will be\nfixed in Linux 2.6.6.\n"
