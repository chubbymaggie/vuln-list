      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-669\nTwo vulnerabilities have been discovered in php4 which also apply to\nthe version of php3 in the stable Debian distribution.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\nThe memory_limit functionality allows remote attackers to execute\n    arbitrary code under certain circumstances.\nThe strip_tags function does not filter null (\\0) characters\n    within tag names when restricting input to allowed tags, which\n    allows dangerous tags to be processed by some web browsers which\n    could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\nDSA-531\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in php4:\nThe memory_limit functionality in PHP 4.x up to\n   4.3.7, and 5.x up to 5.0.0RC3, under certain conditions such as\n   when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to\n   execute arbitrary code by triggering a memory_limit abort during\n   execution of the zend_hash_init function and overwriting a\n   HashTable destructor pointer before the initialization of key data\n   structures is complete.\nThe strip_tags function in PHP 4.x up to 4.3.7, and\n   5.x up to 5.0.0RC3, does not filter null (\\0) characters within tag\n   names when restricting input to allowed tags, which allows\n   dangerous tags to be processed by web browsers such as Internet\n   Explorer and Safari, which ignore null characters and facilitate\n   the exploitation of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n"
