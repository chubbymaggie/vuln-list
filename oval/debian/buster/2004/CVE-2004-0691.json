The first\nproblem allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, while the other\ntwo only seem to pose a denial of service danger.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nvulnerabilities:\nChris Evans has discovered a heap-based overflow when handling\n    8-bit RLE encoded BMP files.\nMarcus Meissner has discovered a crash condition in the XPM\n    handling code, which is not yet fixed in Qt 3.3.\nMarcus Meissner has discovered a crash condition in the GIF\n    handling code, which is not yet fixed in Qt 3.3.\n"
