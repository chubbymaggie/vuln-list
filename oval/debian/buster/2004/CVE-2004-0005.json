      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-434\nStefan Esser discovered several security related problems in Gaim, a\nmulti-protocol instant messaging client.  Not all of them are\napplicable for the version in Debian stable, but affected the version\nin the unstable distribution at least.  The problems were grouped for\nthe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures as follows:\nWhen the Yahoo Messenger handler decodes an octal value for email\n    notification functions two different kinds of overflows can be\n    triggered.  When the MIME decoder decoded a quoted printable\n    encoded string for email notification two other different kinds of\n    overflows can be triggered.  These problems only affect the\n    version in the unstable distribution.\nWhen parsing the cookies within the HTTP reply header of a Yahoo\n    web connection a buffer overflow can happen.  When parsing the\n    Yahoo Login Webpage the YMSG protocol overflows stack buffers if\n    the web page returns oversized values.  When splitting a URL into\n    its parts a stack overflow can be caused.  These problems only\n    affect the version in the unstable distribution.\nWhen an oversized keyname is read from a Yahoo Messenger packet a\n    stack overflow can be triggered.  When Gaim is setup to use an HTTP\n    proxy for connecting to the server a malicious HTTP proxy can\n    exploit it.  These problems affect all versions Debian ships.\n    However, the connection to Yahoo doesn't work in the version in\n    Debian stable.\nInternally data is copied between two tokens into a fixed size\n    stack buffer without a size check.  This only affects the version\n    of gaim in the unstable distribution.\nWhen allocating memory for AIM/Oscar DirectIM packets an integer\n    overflow can happen, resulting in a heap overflow.  This only\n    affects the version of gaim in the unstable distribution.\n"
