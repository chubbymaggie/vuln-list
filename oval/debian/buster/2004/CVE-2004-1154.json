    "Description": "Integer overflow in the Samba daemon (smbd) in Samba 2.x and 3.0.x through 3.0.9 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a Samba request with a large number of security descriptors that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-701\nIt has been discovered that the last security update for Samba, a\nLanManager like file and printer server for GNU/Linux and Unix-like\nsystems caused the daemon to crash upon reload. This has been fixed.\nFor reference below is the original advisory text:\nGreg MacManus discovered an integer overflow in the smb daemon from\nSamba, a LanManager like file and printer server for GNU/Linux and\nUnix-like systems.  Requesting a very large number of access control\ndescriptors from the server could exploit the integer overflow, which\nmay result in a buffer overflow which could lead to the execution of\narbitrary code with root privileges.  Upstream developers have\ndiscovered more possible integer overflows that are fixed with this\nupdate as well.\n"
