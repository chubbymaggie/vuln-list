    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-624\nA buffer overflow has been discovered in zip, the archiver for .zip\nfiles.  When doing recursive folder compression the program did not\ncheck the resulting path length, which would lead to memory being\noverwritten.  A malicious person could convince a user to create an\narchive containing a specially crafted path name, which could lead to\nthe execution of arbitrary code.\n"
