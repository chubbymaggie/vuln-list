    "Description": "Race condition in the rmtree function in the File::Path module in Perl 5.6.1 and 5.8.4 sets read/write permissions for the world, which allows local users to delete arbitrary files and directories, and possibly read files and directories, via a symlink attack.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-620\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Perl, the popular\nscripting language.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nJeroen van Wolffelaar discovered that the rmtree() function in the\n    File::Path module removes directory trees in an insecure manner\n    which could lead to the removal of arbitrary files and directories\n    through a symlink attack.\nTrustix developers discovered several insecure uses of temporary\n    files in many modules which allow a local attacker to overwrite\n    files via a symlink attack.\n"
