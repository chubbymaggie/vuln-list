    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-567\nSeveral problems have been discovered in libtiff, the Tag Image File\nFormat library for processing TIFF graphics files.  An attacker could\nprepare a specially crafted TIFF graphic that would cause the client\nto execute arbitrary code or crash.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures Project has identified the following problems:\nChris Evans discovered several problems in the RLE (run length\n    encoding) decoders that could lead to arbitrary code execution.\nMatthias Clasen discovered a division by zero through an integer\n    overflow.\nDmitry V. Levin discovered several integer overflows that caused\n    malloc issues which can result to either plain crash or memory\n    corruption.\n"
