      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1184\nThis advisory covers the S/390 components of the recent security\nupdate for the Linux 2.6.8 kernel that were missing due to technical\nproblems. For reference, please see the text of the original advisory.\nSeveral security related problems have been discovered in the Linux\nkernel which may lead to a denial of service or even the execution of\narbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nToshihiro Iwamoto discovered a memory leak in the handling of\n    direct I/O writes that allows local users to cause a denial of\n    service.\nA buffer overflow in NFS readlink handling allows a malicious\n    remote server to cause a denial of service.\nStephen Smalley discovered a bug in the SELinux ptrace handling\n    that allows local users with ptrace permissions to change the\n    tracer SID to the SID of another process.\nPavel Kankovsky discovered an information leak in the getsockopt\n    system call which can be exploited by a local program to leak\n    potentially sensitive memory to userspace.\nDouglas Gilbert reported a bug in the sg driver that allows local\n    users to cause a denial of service by performing direct I/O\n    transfers from the sg driver to memory mapped I/O space.\nMattia Belletti noticed that certain debugging code left in the\n    process management code could be exploited by a local attacker to\n    cause a denial of service.\nKostik Belousov discovered a missing LSM file_permission check in\n    the readv and writev functions which might allow attackers to\n    bypass intended access restrictions.\nPatrick McHardy discovered a bug in the SNMP NAT helper that\n    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service.\nA race condition in the socket buffer handling allows remote\n    attackers to cause a denial of service.\nDiego Calleja Garcia discovered a buffer overflow in the DVD\n    handling code that could be exploited by a specially crafted DVD\n    USB storage device to execute arbitrary code.\nA bug in the serial USB driver has been discovered that could be\n    exploited by a custom made USB serial adapter to consume arbitrary\n    amounts of memory.\nJames McKenzie discovered a denial of service vulnerability in the\n    NFS driver.  When exporting an ext3 file system over NFS, a remote\n    attacker could exploit this to trigger a file system panic by\n    sending a specially crafted UDP packet.\nWei Wang discovered a bug in the SCTP implementation that allows\n    local users to cause a denial of service and possibly gain root\n    privileges.\nOlof Johansson discovered that the kernel does not disable the HID0\n    bit on PowerPC 970 processors which could be exploited by a local\n    attacker to cause a denial of service.\nA bug in the Universal Disk Format (UDF) filesystem driver could\n    be exploited by a local user to cause a denial of service.\nDavid Miller reported a problem with the fix for \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3745\"\u003eCVE-2006-3745\u003c/a\u003e\n    that allows local users to crash the system via an SCTP\n    socket with a certain SO_LINGER value.\nThe following matrix explains which kernel version for which\narchitecture fixes the problem mentioned above:\n"
