    "Description": "Multiple integer overflows in Evolution Data Server (aka evolution-data-server) before 2.24.5 allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long string that is converted to a base64 representation in (1) addressbook/libebook/e-vcard.c in evc or (2) camel/camel-mime-utils.c in libcamel.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1813\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in evolution-data-server, the\ndatabase backend server for the evolution groupware suite. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nIt was discovered that evolution-data-server is prone to integer\noverflows triggered by large base64 strings.\nJoachim Breitner discovered that S/MIME signatures are not verified\nproperly, which can lead to spoofing attacks.\nIt was discovered that NTLM authentication challenge packets are not\nvalidated properly when using the NTLM authentication method, which\ncould lead to an information disclosure or a denial of service.\n"
