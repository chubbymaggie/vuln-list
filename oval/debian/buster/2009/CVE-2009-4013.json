    "Description": "Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Lintian 1.23.x through 1.23.28, 1.24.x through 1.24.2.1, and 2.x before 2.3.2 allow remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files or obtain sensitive information via vectors involving (1) control field names, (2) control field values, and (3) control files of patch systems.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1979\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in lintian,\na Debian package checker. The following Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project ids have been assigned to identify them:\nControl field names and values were not sanitised before using them\n    in certain operations that could lead to directory traversals.\nPatch systems' control files were not sanitised before using them\n    in certain operations that could lead to directory traversals.\nAn attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to overwrite\n    arbitrary files or disclose system information.\nMultiple check scripts and the Lintian::Schedule module were using\n    user-provided input as part of the sprintf/printf format string.\nFile names were not properly escaped when passing them as arguments\n    to certain commands, allowing the execution of other commands as\n    pipes or as a set of shell commands.\n"
