    "Description": "Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1892\nIt was discovered that the SIEVE component of dovecot, a mail server\nthat supports mbox and maildir mailboxes, is vulnerable to a buffer\noverflow when processing SIEVE scripts. This can be used to elevate\nprivileges to the dovecot system user.  An attacker who is able to\ninstall SIEVE scripts executed by the server is therefore able to read\nand modify arbitrary email messages on the system.\nDSA-1893\nIt was discovered that the SIEVE component of cyrus-imapd and\nkolab-cyrus-imapd, the Cyrus mail system, is vulnerable to a buffer\noverflow when processing SIEVE scripts.\nThis can be used to elevate privileges to the cyrus system user.  An\nattacker who is able to install SIEVE scripts executed by the server is\ntherefore able to read and modify arbitrary email messages on the\nsystem. The update introduced by \u003ca href=\"$(HOME)/security/2009/dsa-1881\"\u003eDSA\n1881-1\u003c/a\u003e was incomplete and the issue has been given an additional CVE id due\nto its complexity.\n"
