The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nThe following issues have been fixed in both the stable (lenny)\nand the oldstable (etch) distributions:\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n   \n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2687\"\u003eCVE-2009-2687\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3292\"\u003eCVE-2009-3292\u003c/a\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003eThe exif module did not properly handle malformed jpeg files,\n    allowing an attacker to cause a segfault, resulting in a denial\n    of service.\n    \nThe php_openssl_apply_verification_policy() function did not\n    properly perform certificate validation.\nBogdan Calin discovered that a remote attacker could cause a denial\n    of service by uploading a large number of files in using multipart/\n    form-data requests, causing the creation of a large number of\n    temporary files.\nTo address this issue, the max_file_uploads option introduced in PHP\n    5.3.1 has been backported. This option limits the maximum number of\n    files uploaded per request. The default value for this new option is\n    50. See NEWS.Debian for more information.\nThe following issue has been fixed in the stable (lenny) distribution:\nA flaw in the ini_restore() function could lead to a memory\n     disclosure, possibly leading to the disclosure of sensitive data.\nIn the oldstable (etch) distribution, this update also fixes a regression\nintroduced by the fix for\n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5658\"\u003eCVE-2008-5658\u003c/a\u003e\nin DSA-1789-1 (bug #527560).\n"
