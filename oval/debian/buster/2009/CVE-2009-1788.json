    "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in voc_read_header in libsndfile 1.0.15 through 1.0.19, as used in Winamp 5.552 and possibly other media programs, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a VOC file with an invalid header value.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1814\nTwo vulnerabilities have been found in libsndfile, a library to read\nand write sampled audio data.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identified the following problems:\nTobias Klein discovered that the VOC parsing routines suffer of a heap-based\nbuffer overflow which can be triggered by an attacker via a crafted VOC\nheader.\nThe vendor discovered that the  AIFF parsing routines suffer of a heap-based\nbuffer overflow similar to \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1788\"\u003eCVE-2009-1788\u003c/a\u003e which can be triggered by an attacker\nvia a crafted AIFF header.\nIn both cases the overflowing data is not completely attacker controlled but\nstill leads to application crashes or under some circumstances might still\nlead to arbitrary code execution.\n"
