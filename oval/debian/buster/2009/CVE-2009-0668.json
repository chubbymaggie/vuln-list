    "Description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Zope Object Database (ZODB) before 3.8.2, when certain Zope Enterprise Objects (ZEO) database sharing is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Python code via vectors involving the ZEO network protocol.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2234\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in python-zodb, a set of\ntools for using ZODB, that could lead to arbitrary code execution in the worst\ncase. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\nThe ZEO server doesn't restrict the callables when unpickling data\n   received from a malicious client which can be used by an attacker to execute\n   arbitrary Python code on the server by sending certain exception pickles. This\n   also allows an attacker to import any importable module as ZEO is importing the\n   module containing a callable specified in a pickle to test for a certain flag.\nDue to a programming error, an authorization method in the StorageServer\n   component of ZEO was not used as an internal method. This allows a malicious\n   client to bypass authentication when connecting to a ZEO server by simply\n   calling this authorization method.\nThe update also limits the number of new object ids a client can request\nto 100 as it would be possible to consume huge amounts of resources by\nrequesting a big batch of new object ids. No CVE id has been assigned to this.\nDSA-1863\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the zope,\na feature-rich web application server written in python, that could\nlead to arbitrary code execution in the worst case.
