    "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in a regular-expression parser in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.12.3, as used in Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, Evolution, Pidgin, and AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), allows remote SSL servers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, related to the cert_TestHostName function.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1874\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Network Security\nService libraries. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nMoxie Marlinspike discovered that a buffer overflow in the regular\n   expression parser could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nDan Kaminsky discovered that NULL characters in certificate\n   names could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks by tricking the user\n   into accepting a rogue certificate.\nCertificates with MD2 hash signatures are no longer accepted\n   since they're no longer considered cryptograhically secure.\nThe old stable distribution (etch) doesn't contain nss.\n"
