The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nCross site scripting vulnerability in the export page allow for an\n  attacker that can place crafted cookies with the user to inject\n  arbitrary web script or HTML.\nStatic code injection allows for a remote attacker to inject arbitrary\n  code into phpMyAdmin via the setup.php script. This script is in Debian\n  under normal circumstances protected via Apache authentication.\n  However, because of a recent worm based on this exploit, we are patching\n  it regardless, to also protect installations that somehow still expose\n  the setup.php script.\n"
