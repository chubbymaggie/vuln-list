The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\nGunnar Wrobel discovered a directory traversal vulnerability, which\nallows attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via the\ndriver parameter in Horde_Image.\nIt was discovered that an attacker could perform a cross-site scripting\nattack via the contact name, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary\nhtml code. This requires that the attacker has access to create\ncontacts.\nIt was discovered that the horde XSS filter is prone to a cross-site\nscripting attack, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary html code.\nThis is only exploitable when Internet Explorer is used.\n"
