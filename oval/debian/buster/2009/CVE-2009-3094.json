    "Description": "The ap_proxy_ftp_handler function in modules/proxy/proxy_ftp.c in the mod_proxy_ftp module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.63 and 2.2.13 allows remote FTP servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and child process crash) via a malformed reply to an EPSV command.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1934\nA design flaw has been found in the TLS and SSL protocol that allows\nan attacker to inject arbitrary content at the beginning of a TLS/SSL\nconnection. The attack is related to the way how TLS and SSL handle\nsession renegotiations. \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555\"\u003eCVE-2009-3555\u003c/a\u003e has been assigned to this\nvulnerability.\nAs a partial mitigation against this attack, this apache2 update\ndisables client-initiated renegotiations. This should fix the\nvulnerability for the majority of Apache configurations in use.\nNOTE: This is not a complete fix for the problem. The attack is\nstill possible in configurations where the server initiates the\nrenegotiation. This is the case for the following configurations\n(the information in the changelog of the updated packages is\nslightly inaccurate):\nAs a workaround, you may rearrange your configuration in a way that\nSSLVerifyClient and SSLCipherSuite are only used on the server or\nvirtual host level.\nA complete fix for the problem will require a protocol change. Further\ninformation will be included in a separate announcement about this\nissue.\nIn addition, this update fixes the following issues in Apache's\nmod_proxy_ftp:\nInsufficient input validation in the mod_proxy_ftp module allowed remote FTP\nservers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and child\nprocess crash) via a malformed reply to an EPSV command.\nInsufficient input validation in the mod_proxy_ftp module allowed remote\nauthenticated attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and send\narbitrary FTP commands to an FTP server.\nThe oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.2.3-4+etch11.\n"
