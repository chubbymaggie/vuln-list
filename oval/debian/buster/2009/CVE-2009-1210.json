    "Description": "Format string vulnerability in the PROFINET/DCP (PN-DCP) dissector in Wireshark 1.0.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a PN-DCP packet with format string specifiers in the station name.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1785\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark\nnetwork traffic analyzer, which may lead to denial of service or the\nexecution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nA format string vulnerability was discovered in the PROFINET\n    dissector.\nThe dissector for the Check Point High-Availability Protocol\n    could be forced to crash.\nMalformed Tektronix files could lead to a crash.\nThe old stable distribution (etch), is only affected by the\nCPHAP crash, which doesn't warrant an update on its own. The fix\nwill be queued up for an upcoming security update or a point release.\n"
