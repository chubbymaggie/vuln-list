    "Description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in WebKit, as used in Apple Safari before 4.0, iPhone OS 1.0 through 2.2.1, iPhone OS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1, Google Chrome 1.0.154.53, and possibly other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) by setting an unspecified property of an HTML tag that causes child elements to be freed and later accessed when an HTML error occurs, related to \"recursion in certain DOM event handlers.\"",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1868\nSeveral security issues have been discovered in kde4libs, core libraries\nfor all KDE 4 applications. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nIt was discovered that there is a use-after-free flaw in handling\ncertain DOM event handlers. This could lead to the execution of\narbitrary code, when visiting a malicious website.\nIt was discovered that there could be an uninitialised pointer when\nhandling a Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) attr function call. This could\nlead to the execution of arbitrary code, when visiting a malicious\nwebsite.\nIt was discovered that the JavaScript garbage collector does not handle\nallocation failures properly, which could lead to the execution of\narbitrary code when visiting a malicious website.\nThe oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain kde4libs.\n"
