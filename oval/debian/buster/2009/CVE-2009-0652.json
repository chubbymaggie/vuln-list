The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\nMoxie Marlinspike discovered that Unicode box drawing characters inside of\n    internationalised domain names could be used for phishing attacks.\nOlli Pettay, Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren, Oleg Romashin, Jesse Ruderman\n    and Gary Kwong reported crashes in the layout engine, which might\n    allow the execution of arbitrary code.\nOlli Pettay, Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren, Oleg Romashin, Jesse Ruderman\n    and Gary Kwong reported crashes in the layout engine, which might\n    allow the execution of arbitrary code.\nIgor Bukanov and Bob Clary discovered crashes in the Javascript engine,\n    which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\nIgor Bukanov and Bob Clary discovered crashes in the Javascript engine,\n    which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\nDaniel Veditz discovered that the Content-Disposition: header is ignored\n    within the jar: URI scheme.\nGregory Fleischer discovered that the same-origin policy for Flash files\n    is inproperly enforced for files loaded through the view-source scheme,\n    which may result in bypass of cross-domain policy restrictions.\nCefn Hoile discovered that sites, which allow the embedding of third-party\n    stylesheets are vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks through XBL\n    bindings.\n\"moz_bug_r_a4\" discovered bypasses of the same-origin policy in the\n    XMLHttpRequest Javascript API and the XPCNativeWrapper.\nPaolo Amadini discovered that incorrect handling of POST data when\n    saving a web site with an embedded frame may lead to information disclosure.\nIt was discovered that Iceweasel allows Refresh: headers to redirect\n    to Javascript URIs, resulting in cross-site scripting.\n"
