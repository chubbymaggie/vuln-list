      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1930\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in drupal6, a fully-featured\ncontent management framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nGerhard Killesreiter discovered a flaw in the way user signatures are\nhandled. It is possible for a user to inject arbitrary code via a\ncrafted user signature. (SA-CORE-2009-007)\nMark Piper, Sven Herrmann and Brandon Knight discovered a cross-site\nscripting issue in the forum module, which could be exploited via the\ntid parameter. (SA-CORE-2009-007)\nSumit Datta discovered that certain drupal6 pages leak sensitive\ninformation such as user credentials. (SA-CORE-2009-007)\nSeveral design flaws in the OpenID module have been fixed, which could\nlead to cross-site request forgeries or privilege escalations. Also, the\nfile upload function does not process all extensions properly leading\nto the possible execution of arbitrary code.\n(SA-CORE-2009-008)\nThe oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain drupal6.\n"
