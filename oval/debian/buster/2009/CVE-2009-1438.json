    "Description": "Integer overflow in the CSoundFile::ReadMed function (src/load_med.cpp) in libmodplug before 0.8.6, as used in gstreamer-plugins, TTPlayer, and other products, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a MED file with a crafted (1) song comment or (2) song name, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild in August 2008.",

The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\nIt was discovered that libmodplug is prone to an integer overflow when\nprocessing a MED file with a crafted song comment or song name.\nIt was discovered that libmodplug is prone to a buffer overflow in the\nPATinst function, when processing a long instrument name.\n"
