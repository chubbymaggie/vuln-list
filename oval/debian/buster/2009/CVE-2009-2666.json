    "Description": "socket.c in fetchmail before 6.3.11 does not properly handle a '\\0' character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1852\nIt was discovered that fetchmail, a full-featured remote mail retrieval\nand forwarding utility, is vulnerable to the \"Null Prefix Attacks Against\nSSL/TLS Certificates\" recently published at the Blackhat conference.\nThis allows an attacker to perform undetected man-in-the-middle attacks\nvia a crafted ITU-T X.509 certificate with an injected null byte in the\nsubjectAltName or Common Name fields.\nNote, as a fetchmail user you should always use strict certificate\nvalidation through either these option combinations:\n    sslcertck ssl sslproto ssl3    (for service on SSL-wrapped ports)\nor\n    sslcertck sslproto tls1        (for STARTTLS-based services)\n"
