    "Description": "Multiple buffer overflows in the CMU Cyrus SASL library before 2.1.23 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via strings that are used as input to the sasl_encode64 function in lib/saslutil.c.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1807\nJames Ralston discovered that the sasl_encode64() function of cyrus-sasl2,\na free library implementing the Simple Authentication and Security Layer,\nsuffers from a missing null termination in certain situations.  This causes\nseveral buffer overflows in situations where cyrus-sasl2 itself requires\nthe string to be null terminated which can lead to denial of service or\narbitrary code execution.\nImportant notice (Quoting from US-CERT):\nWhile this patch will fix currently vulnerable code, it can cause\nnon-vulnerable existing code to break. Here's a function prototype from\ninclude/saslutil.h to clarify my explanation:\nAssume a scenario where calling code has been written in such a way that it\ncalculates the exact size required for base64 encoding in advance, then\nallocates a buffer of that exact size, passing a pointer to the buffer into\nsasl_encode64() as *out. As long as this code does not anticipate that the\nbuffer is NUL-terminated (does not call any string-handling functions like\nstrlen(), for example) the code will work and it will not be vulnerable.\nOnce this patch is applied, that same code will break because sasl_encode64()\nwill begin to return SASL_BUFOVER.\n"
