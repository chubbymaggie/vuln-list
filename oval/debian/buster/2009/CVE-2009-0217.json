    "Description": "The design of the W3C XML Signature Syntax and Processing (XMLDsig) recommendation, as implemented in products including (1) the Oracle Security Developer Tools component in Oracle Application Server 10.1.2.3, 10.1.3.4, and 10.1.4.3IM; (2) the WebLogic Server component in BEA Product Suite 10.3, 10.0 MP1, 9.2 MP3, 9.1, 9.0, and 8.1 SP6; (3) Mono before 2.4.2.2; (4) XML Security Library before 1.2.12; (5) IBM WebSphere Application Server Versions 6.0 through 6.0.2.33, 6.1 through 6.1.0.23, and 7.0 through 7.0.0.1; (6) Sun JDK and JRE Update 14 and earlier; (7) Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 through 3.0 SP2, 3.5, and 4.0; and other products uses a parameter that defines an HMAC truncation length (HMACOutputLength) but does not require a minimum for this length, which allows attackers to spoof HMAC-based signatures and bypass authentication by specifying a truncation length with a small number of bits.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1849\nIt was discovered that the W3C XML Signature recommendation contains a\nprotocol-level vulnerability related to HMAC output truncation.  This\nupdate implements the proposed workaround in the C++ version of the\nApache implementation of this standard, xml-security-c, by preventing\ntruncation to output strings shorter than 80 bits or half of the\noriginal HMAC output, whichever is greater.\n"
