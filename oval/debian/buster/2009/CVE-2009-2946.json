      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1878\nRaphael Geissert discovered that uscan, a program to check for\navailability of new source code versions which is part of the\ndevscripts package, runs Perl code downloaded from potentially\nuntrusted sources to implement its URL and version mangling\nfunctionality.  This update addresses this issue by reimplementing the\nrelevant Perl operators without relying on the Perl interpreter,\ntrying to preserve backwards compatibility as much as possible.\n"
