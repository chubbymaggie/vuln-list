The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nCross site scripting was possible through a number of pages which\n    allowed an attacker to steal sensitive session data.\nCode injection was possible when SquirrelMail was configured to\n    use the map_yp_alias function to authenticate users. This is not\n    the default.\nIt was possible to hijack an active user session by planting a\n    specially crafted cookie into the user's browser.\nSpecially crafted HTML emails could use the CSS positioning feature\n    to place email content over the SquirrelMail user interface, allowing\n    for phishing.\n"
