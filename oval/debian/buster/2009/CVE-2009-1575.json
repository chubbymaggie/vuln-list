      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1792\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in drupal, a web content\nmanagement system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\npod.Edge discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability due that can be\n    triggered when some browsers interpret UTF-8 strings as UTF-7 if they\n    appear before the generated HTML document defines its Content-Type.\n    This allows a malicious user to execute arbitrary javascript in the\n    context of the web site if they're allowed to post content.\nMoritz Naumann discovered an information disclosure vulnerability. If\n    a user is tricked into visiting the site via a specially crafted URL\n    and then submits a form (such as the search box) from that page, the\n    information in their form submission may be directed to a third-party\n    site determined by the URL and thus disclosed to the third party. The\n    third party site may then execute a cross-site request forgery attack\n    against the submitted form.\nThe old stable distribution (etch) does not contain drupal and is not\naffected.\n"
