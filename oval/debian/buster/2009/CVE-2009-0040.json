      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1830\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Icedove\nmail client, an unbranded version of the Thunderbird mail client. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\nThe execution of arbitrary code might be possible via a crafted PNG file\nthat triggers a free of an uninitialized pointer in (1) the png_read_png\nfunction, (2) pCAL chunk handling, or (3) setup of 16-bit gamma tables. \n(MFSA 2009-10)\nIt is possible to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the\nlayout engine. (MFSA 2009-01)\nIt is possible to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the\nJavaScript engine. (MFSA 2009-01)\nBjoern Hoehrmann and Moxie Marlinspike discovered a possible spoofing\nattack via Unicode box drawing characters in internationalized domain\nnames. (MFSA 2009-15)\nMemory corruption and assertion failures have been discovered in the\nlayout engine, leading to the possible execution of arbitrary code. \n(MFSA 2009-07)\nThe layout engine allows the execution of arbitrary code in vectors\nrelated to nsCSSStyleSheet::GetOwnerNode, events, and garbage\ncollection. (MFSA 2009-07)\nThe JavaScript engine is prone to the execution of arbitrary code via\nseveral vectors. (MFSA 2009-07)\nThe layout engine allows the execution of arbitrary code via vectors\nrelated to gczeal. (MFSA 2009-07)\nGeorgi Guninski discovered that it is possible to obtain xml data via\nan issue related to the nsIRDFService. (MFSA 2009-09)\nThe browser engine is prone to a possible memory corruption via several\nvectors. (MFSA 2009-14)\nThe browser engine is prone to a possible memory corruption via the\nnsSVGElement::BindToTree function. (MFSA 2009-14)\nGregory Fleischer discovered that it is possible to bypass the Same\nOrigin Policy when opening a Flash file via the view-source: scheme.\n(MFSA 2009-17)\nThe possible arbitrary execution of code was discovered via vectors\ninvolving \"double frame construction.\" (MFSA 2009-24)\nSeveral issues were discovered in the browser engine as used by icedove,\nwhich could lead to the possible execution of arbitrary code.\n(MFSA 2009-24)\nShuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang and Ming Zhang reported a potential\nman-in-the-middle attack, when using a proxy due to insufficient checks\non a certain proxy response. (MFSA 2009-27)\nmoz_bug_r_a4 discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary\nJavaScript with chrome privileges due to an error in the\ngarbage collection implementation. (MFSA 2009-29)\nmoz_bug_r_a4 reported that it is possible for scripts from page content\nto run with elevated privileges and thus potentially executing arbitrary\ncode with the object's chrome privileges. (MFSA 2009-32)\nBernd Jendrissek discovered a potentially exploitable crash when viewing\na multipart/alternative mail message with a text/enhanced part.\n(MFSA 2009-33)\n"
