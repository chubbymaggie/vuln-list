      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1820\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a\nruntime environment for XUL applications, such as the Iceweasel web\nbrowser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\nSeveral issues in the browser engine have been discovered, which can\nresult in the execution of arbitrary code. (MFSA 2009-24)\nIt is possible to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving \"double\nframe construction.\" (MFSA 2009-24)\nJesse Ruderman and Adam Hauner discovered a problem in the JavaScript\nengine, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n(MFSA 2009-24)\nPavel Cvrcek discovered a potential issue leading to a spoofing attack\non the location bar related to certain invalid unicode characters.\n(MFSA 2009-25)\nGregory Fleischer discovered that it is possible to read arbitrary\ncookies via a crafted HTML document. (MFSA 2009-26)\nShuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang and Ming Zhang reported a potential\nman-in-the-middle attack, when using a proxy due to insufficient checks\non a certain proxy response. (MFSA 2009-27)\nJakob Balle and Carsten Eiram reported a race condition in the\nNPObjWrapper_NewResolve function that can be used to execute arbitrary\ncode. (MFSA 2009-28)\nmoz_bug_r_a4 discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary\nJavaScript with chrome privileges due to an error in the\ngarbage-collection implementation. (MFSA 2009-29)\nAdam Barth and Collin Jackson reported a potential privilege escalation\nwhen loading a file::resource via the location bar. (MFSA 2009-30)\nWladimir Palant discovered that it is possible to bypass access\nrestrictions due to a lack of content policy check, when loading a\nscript file into a XUL document. (MFSA 2009-31)\nmoz_bug_r_a4 reported that it is possible for scripts from page content\nto run with elevated privileges and thus potentially executing arbitrary\ncode with the object's chrome privileges. (MFSA 2009-32)\n"
