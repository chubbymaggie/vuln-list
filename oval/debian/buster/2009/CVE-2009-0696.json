    "Description": "The dns_db_findrdataset function in db.c in named in ISC BIND 9.4 before 9.4.3-P3, 9.5 before 9.5.1-P3, and 9.6 before 9.6.1-P1, when configured as a master server, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via an ANY record in the prerequisite section of a crafted dynamic update message, as exploited in the wild in July 2009.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1847\nIt was discovered that the BIND DNS server terminates when processing a\nspecially crafted dynamic DNS update.  This vulnerability affects all\nBIND servers which serve at least one DNS zone authoritatively, as a\nmaster, even if dynamic updates are not enabled.  The default Debian\nconfiguration for resolvers includes several authoritative zones, too,\nso resolvers are also affected by this issue unless these zones have\nbeen removed.\n"
