      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1841\nIt was discovered that git-daemon which is part of git-core, a popular\ndistributed revision control system, is vulnerable to denial of service\nattacks caused by a programming mistake in handling requests containing\nextra unrecognized arguments which results in an infinite loop. While\nthis is no problem for the daemon itself as every request will spawn a\nnew git-daemon instance, this still results in a very high CPU consumption\nand might lead to denial of service conditions.\n"
