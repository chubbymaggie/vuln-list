    "Description": "The TLS protocol, and the SSL protocol 3.0 and possibly earlier, as used in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0, mod_ssl in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.14 and earlier, OpenSSL before 0.9.8l, GnuTLS 2.8.5 and earlier, Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) 3.12.4 and earlier, multiple Cisco products, and other products, does not properly associate renegotiation handshakes with an existing connection, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert data into HTTPS sessions, and possibly other types of sessions protected by TLS or SSL, by sending an unauthenticated request that is processed retroactively by a server in a post-renegotiation context, related to a \"plaintext injection\" attack, aka the \"Project Mogul\" issue.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3253\nPound, a HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer, had several issues\nrelated to vulnerabilities in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.\nFor Debian 7 (wheezy) this update adds a missing part to make it actually\npossible to disable client-initiated renegotiation and disables it by default\n(\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555\"\u003eCVE-2009-3555\u003c/a\u003e).\nTLS compression is disabled (\u003ca\nhref=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4929\"\u003eCVE-2012-4929\u003c/a\u003e),\nalthough this is normally already disabled by the OpenSSL system library.\nFinally it adds the ability to disable the SSLv3 protocol (\u003ca\nhref=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3566\"\u003eCVE-2014-3566\u003c/a\u003e)\nentirely via the new \u003cq\u003eDisableSSLv3\u003c/q\u003e configuration directive, although it\nwill not disabled by default in this update. Additionally a non-security\nsensitive issue in redirect encoding is\naddressed.\nFor Debian 8 (jessie) these issues have been fixed prior to the release,\nwith the exception of client-initiated renegotiation (\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555\"\u003eCVE-2009-3555\u003c/a\u003e).\nThis update addresses that issue for jessie.\n"
