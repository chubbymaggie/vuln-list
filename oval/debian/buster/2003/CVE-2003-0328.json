    "Description": "EPIC IRC Client (EPIC4) pre2.002, pre2.003, and possibly later versions, allows remote malicious IRC servers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a CTCP request from a large nickname, which causes an incorrect length calculation.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-399\nJeremy Nelson discovered a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in\nEPIC4, a popular client for Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  A malicious\nserver could craft a reply which triggers the client to allocate a\nnegative amount of memory.  This could lead to a denial of service if\nthe client only crashes, but may also lead to executing of arbitrary\ncode under the user id of the chatting user.\n"
