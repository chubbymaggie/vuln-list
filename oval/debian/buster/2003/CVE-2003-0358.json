    "Description": "Buffer overflow in (1) nethack 3.4.0 and earlier, and (2) falconseye 1.9.3 and earlier, which is based on nethack, allows local users to gain privileges via a long -s command line option.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-316\nThe nethack and slashem packages are vulnerable to a buffer overflow exploited via a\nlong '-s' command line option.  This vulnerability could be used by an\nattacker to gain gid 'games' on a system where nethack is installed.\nAdditionally, some setgid binaries in the nethack package have\nincorrect permissions, which could allow a user who gains gid 'games'\nto replace these binaries, potentially causing other users to execute\nmalicious code when they run nethack.\nNote that slashem does not contain the file permission problem\nCAN-2003-0359.\nDSA-350\nThe falconseye package is vulnerable to a buffer overflow exploited\nvia a long \u003ckbd\u003e-s\u003c/kbd\u003e command line option.  This vulnerability could be used\nby an attacker to gain gid 'games' on a system where falconseye is\ninstalled.\nNote that falconseye does not contain the file permission error\nCAN-2003-0359 which affected some other nethack packages.\n"
