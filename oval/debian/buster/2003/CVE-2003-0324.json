    "Description": "Buffer overflows in EPIC IRC Client (EPIC4) 1.0.1 allows remote malicious IRC servers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via long replies that are not properly handled by the (1) userhost_cmd_returned function, or (2) Statusbar capability.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-287\nTimo Sirainen discovered several problems in EPIC, a popular client\nfor Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  A malicious server could craft special\nreply strings, triggering the client to write beyond buffer\nboundaries.  This could lead to a denial of service if the client only\ncrashes, but may also lead to executing of arbitrary code under the\nuser id of the chatting user.\n"
