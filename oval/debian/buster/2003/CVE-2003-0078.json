    "Description": "ssl3_get_record in s3_pkt.c for OpenSSL before 0.9.7a and 0.9.6 before 0.9.6i does not perform a MAC computation if an incorrect block cipher padding is used, which causes an information leak (timing discrepancy) that may make it easier to launch cryptographic attacks that rely on distinguishing between padding and MAC verification errors, possibly leading to extraction of the original plaintext, aka the \"Vaudenay timing attack.\"",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-253\nA vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Socket Layer\n(SSL) implementation.  In an upcoming paper, Brice Canvel (EPFL),\nAlain Hiltgen (UBS), Serge Vaudenay (EPFL), and Martin Vuagnoux (EPFL,\nIlion) describe and demonstrate a timing-based attack on CBC cipher\nsuites used in SSL and TLS.  OpenSSL has been found to be vulnerable to\nthis attack.\n"
