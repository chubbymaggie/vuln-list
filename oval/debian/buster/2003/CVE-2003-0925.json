The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nA buffer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n   service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a malformed GTP\n   MSISDN string.\nVia certain malformed ISAKMP or MEGACO packets remote attackers are\n   able to cause a denial of service (crash).\nA heap-based buffer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a\n   denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via\n   the SOCKS dissector.\nThe SMB dissector allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n   service via a malformed SMB packet that triggers a segmentation\n   fault during processing of selected packets.\nThe Q.931 dissector allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n   service (crash) via a malformed Q.931, which triggers a null\n   dereference.\n"
