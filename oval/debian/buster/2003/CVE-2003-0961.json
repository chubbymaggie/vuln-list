      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-433\nRed Hat and SuSE kernel and security teams revealed an integer overflow\nin the do_brk() function of the Linux kernel allows local users to\ngain root privileges.\nDSA-475\nSeveral local root exploits have been discovered recently in the Linux\nkernel.  This security advisory updates the PA-RISC kernel 2.4.18 for\nDebian GNU/Linux.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems that are fixed with this update:\nAn integer overflow in brk() system call (do_brk() function) for\n   Linux allows a local attacker to gain root privileges.  Fixed\n   upstream in Linux 2.4.23.\nPaul Starzetz discovered a flaw in bounds checking in mremap() in\n   the Linux kernel (present in version 2.4.x and 2.6.x) which may\n   allow a local attacker to gain root privileges.  Version 2.2 is not\n   affected by this bug.  Fixed upstream in Linux 2.4.24.\nPaul Starzetz and Wojciech Purczynski of isec.pl discovered a\n   critical security vulnerability in the memory management code of\n   Linux inside the mremap(2) system call.  Due to missing function\n   return value check of internal functions a local attacker can gain\n   root privileges.  Fixed upstream in Linux 2.4.25 and 2.6.3.\nPlease note that the source package has to include a lot of updates in\norder to compile the package, which wasn't possible with the old\nsource package.\nDSA-470\nSeveral local root exploits have been discovered recently in the Linux\nkernel.
