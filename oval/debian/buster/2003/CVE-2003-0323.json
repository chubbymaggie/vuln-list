    "Description": "Multiple buffer overflows in ircII 20020912 allows remote malicious IRC servers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via responses that are not properly fed to the my_strcat function by (1) ctcp_buffer, (2) cannot_join_channel, (3) status_make_printable for Statusbar drawing, (4) create_server_list, and possibly other functions.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-298\nTimo Sirainen discovered several problems in EPIC4, a popular client\nfor Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  A malicious server could craft special\nreply strings, triggering the client to write beyond buffer\nboundaries.  This could lead to a denial of service if the client only\ncrashes, but may also lead to executing of arbitrary code under the\nuser id of the chatting user.\nDSA-291\nTimo Sirainen discovered several problems in ircII, a popular\nclient for Internet Relay Chat (IRC).
