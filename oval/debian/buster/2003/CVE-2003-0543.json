    "Description": "Integer overflow in OpenSSL 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via an SSL client certificate with certain ASN.1 tag values.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-393\nDr. Stephen Henson (\u003cemail \"steve@openssl.org\"\u003e), using a test suite\nprovided by NISCC (\u003curl \"http://www.niscc.gov.uk/\"\u003e), discovered a number of\nerrors in the OpenSSL\nASN1 code.  Combined with an error that causes the OpenSSL code to parse\nclient certificates even when it should not, these errors can cause a\ndenial of service (DoS) condition on a system using the OpenSSL code,\ndepending on how that code is used. For example, even though apache-ssl\nand ssh link to OpenSSL libraries, they should not be affected by this\nvulnerability. However, other SSL-enabled applications may be\nvulnerable and an OpenSSL upgrade is recommended.\n"
