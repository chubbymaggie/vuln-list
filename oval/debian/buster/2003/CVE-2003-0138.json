      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-269\nA cryptographic weakness in version 4 of the Kerberos protocol allows\nan attacker to use a chosen-plaintext attack to impersonate any\nprincipal in a realm.  Additional cryptographic weaknesses in the krb4\nimplementation permit the use of cut-and-paste attacks to fabricate\nkrb4 tickets for unauthorized client principals if triple-DES keys are\nused to key krb4 services.  These attacks can subvert a site's entire\nKerberos authentication infrastructure.\nThis version of the heimdal package changes the default behavior and\ndisallows cross-realm authentication for Kerberos version 4.  Because\nof the fundamental nature of the problem, cross-realm authentication\nin Kerberos version 4 cannot be made secure and sites should avoid its\nuse.  A new option (--kerberos4-cross-realm) is provided to the kdc \ncommand to re-enable version 4 cross-realm authentication for those\nsites that must use this functionality but desire the other security\nfixes.\nDSA-273\nA cryptographic weakness in version 4 of the Kerberos protocol allows\nan attacker to use a chosen-plaintext attack to impersonate any\nprincipal in a realm.
