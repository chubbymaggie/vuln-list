    "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in rsync before 2.5.7, when running in server mode, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code and possibly escape the chroot jail.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-404\nThe rsync team has received evidence that a vulnerability in all\nversions of rsync prior to 2.5.7, a fast remote file copy program, was\nrecently used in combination with a Linux kernel vulnerability to\ncompromise the security of a public rsync server.\nWhile this heap overflow vulnerability could not be used by itself to\nobtain root access on an rsync server, it could be used in combination\nwith the recently announced do_brk() vulnerability in the Linux kernel\nto produce a full remote compromise.\nPlease note that this vulnerability only affects the use of rsync as\nan \"rsync server\".  To see if you are running a rsync server you\nshould use the command \"\u003ckbd\u003enetstat -a -n\u003c/kbd\u003e\" to see if you are listening on\nTCP port 873.  If you are not listening on TCP port 873 then you are\nnot running an rsync server.\n"
