    "Description": "Integer overflow in the xdrmem_getbytes() function, and possibly other functions, of XDR (external data representation) libraries derived from SunRPC, including libnsl, libc, glibc, and dietlibc, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain integer values in length fields, a different vulnerability than CVE-2002-0391.",

This\nfunction is part of the XDR encoder/decoder derived from Sun's RPC\nimplementation.  Depending upon the application, this vulnerability\ncan cause buffer overflows and could possibly be exploited to execute\narbitrary code.\nDSA-282\neEye Digital Security discovered an integer overflow in the\nxdrmem_getbytes() function which is also present in GNU libc.
