      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-245\nFlorian Lohoff discovered a bug in the dhcrelay causing it to send a\ncontinuing packet storm towards the configured DHCP server(s) in case\nof a malicious BOOTP packet, such as sent from buggy Cisco switches.\nWhen the dhcp-relay receives a BOOTP request it forwards the request\nto the DHCP server using the broadcast MAC address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\nwhich causes the network interface to reflect the packet back into the\nsocket.  To prevent loops the dhcrelay checks whether the\nrelay-address is its own, in which case the packet would be dropped.\nIn combination with a missing upper boundary for the hop counter an\nattacker can force the dhcp-relay to send a continuing packet storm\ntowards the configured dhcp server(s).\nThis patch introduces a new command line switch \u003ckbd\u003e-c maxcount\u003c/kbd\u003e and\npeople are advised to start the dhcp-relay with \u003ckbd\u003edhcrelay -c 10\u003c/kbd\u003e\nor a smaller number, which will only create that many packets.\nThe dhcrelay program from the \"dhcp\" package does not seem to be\naffected since DHCP packets are dropped if they were apparently\nrelayed already.\n"
