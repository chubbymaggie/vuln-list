    "Description": "The Eterm terminal emulator 0.9.1 and earlier allows attackers to modify the window title via a certain character escape sequence and then insert it back to the command line in the user's terminal, e.g. when the user views a file containing the malicious sequence, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-496\nH.D. Moore discovered several terminal emulator security issues.  One\nof them covers escape codes that are interpreted by the terminal\nemulator.  This could be exploited by an attacker to insert malicious\ncommands hidden for the user, who has to hit enter to continue, which\nwould also execute the hidden commands.\n"
