      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-254\nA vulnerability has been discovered in NANOG traceroute, an enhanced\nversion of the Van Jacobson/BSD traceroute program.  A buffer overflow\noccurs in the 'get_origin()' function.  Due to insufficient bounds\nchecking performed by the whois parser, it may be possible to corrupt\nmemory on the system stack.  This vulnerability can be exploited by a\nremote attacker to gain root privileges on a target host.  Though,\nmost probably not in Debian.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project additionally\nidentified the following vulnerabilities which were already fixed in\nthe Debian version in stable (woody) and oldstable (potato) and are\nmentioned here for completeness (and since other distributions had to\nrelease a separate advisory for them):\nFortunately, the Debian package drops privileges quite early after\nstartup, so those problems are not likely to result in an exploit on a\nDebian machine.\n"
