    "AffectedList": [
      {

    "Description": "buffer overflows",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-165\nMordred Labs and others found several vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL,\nan object-relational SQL database.  They are inherited from several\nbuffer overflows and integer overflows.  Specially crafted long date\nand time input, currency, repeat data and long timezone names could\ncause the PostgreSQL server to crash as well as specially crafted\ninput data for lpad() and rpad().  More buffer/integer overflows were\nfound in circle_poly(), path_encode() and path_addr().\nExcept for the last three, these problems are fixed in the upstream\nrelease 7.2.2 of PostgreSQL which is the recommended version to use.\nMost of these problems do not exist in the version of PostgreSQL that\nDebian ships in the potato release since the corresponding\nfunctionality is not yet implemented.  However, PostgreSQL 6.5.3 is\nquite old and may bear more risks than we are aware of, which may\ninclude further buffer overflows, and certainly include bugs that\nthreaten the integrity of your data.\nYou are strongly advised not to use this release but to upgrade your\nsystem to Debian 3.0 (stable) including PostgreSQL release 7.2.1\ninstead, where many bugs have been fixed and new features introduced\nto increase compatibility with the SQL standards.\nIf you consider an upgrade, please make sure to dump the entire\ndatabase system using the pg_dumpall utility.  Please take into\nconsideration that the newer PostgreSQL is more strict in its input\nhandling.  This means that tests like \"foo = NULL\" which are not valid\nwon't be accepted anymore.  It also means that when using UNICODE\nencoding, ISO 8859-1 and ISO 8859-15 are no longer valid encodings to\nuse when inserting data into the relation.  In such a case you are\nadvised to convert the dump in question using\n\u003ckbd\u003erecode latin1..utf-16\u003c/kbd\u003e.\nThese problems have been fixed in version 7.2.1-2woody2 for the\ncurrent stable distribution (woody) and in version 7.2.2-2 for the\nunstable distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is\npartially affected and we ship a fixed version 6.5.3-27.2 for it.\nWe recommend that you upgrade your PostgreSQL packages.\n"
