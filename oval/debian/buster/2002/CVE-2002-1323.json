    "Description": "Safe.pm 2.0.7 and earlier, when used in Perl 5.8.0 and earlier, may allow attackers to break out of safe compartments in (1) Safe::reval or (2) Safe::rdo using a redefined @_ variable, which is not reset between successive calls.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-208\nA security hole has been discovered in Safe.pm which is used in all\nversions of Perl.  The Safe extension module allows the creation of\ncompartments in which perl code can be evaluated in a new namespace\nand the code evaluated in the compartment cannot refer to variables\noutside this namespace.  However, when a Safe compartment has already\nbeen used, there's no guarantee that it is Safe any longer, because\nthere's a way for code to be executed within the Safe compartment to\nalter its operation mask.  Thus, programs that use a Safe compartment\nonly once aren't affected by this bug.\nThis problem has been fixed in version 5.6.1-8.2 for the current\nstable distribution (woody), in version 5.004.05-6.2 and 5.005.03-7.2\nfor the old stable distribution (potato) and in version 5.8.0-14 for\nthe unstable distribution (sid).\nWe recommend that you upgrade your Perl packages.\n"
