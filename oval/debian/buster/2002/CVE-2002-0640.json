    "Description": "Buffer overflow in sshd in OpenSSH 2.3.1 through 3.3 may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large number of responses during challenge response authentication when OpenBSD is using PAM modules with interactive keyboard authentication (PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt).",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-134\nISS X-Force released an advisory about an OpenSSH \"Remote Challenge\nVulnerability\". Unfortunately, the advisory was incorrect on some\npoints, leading to widespread confusion about the impact of this\nvulnerability. No version of OpenSSH in Debian is affected by the\nSKEY and BSD_AUTH authentication methods described in the ISS\nadvisory. However, Debian does include OpenSSH servers with the PAM\nfeature described as vulnerable in the later advisory by the OpenSSH\nteam. (This vulnerable feature is authentication using PAM via the\nkeyboard-interactive mechanism [kbdint].) This vulnerability affects\nOpenSSH versions 2.3.1 through 3.3. No exploit is currently known for\nthe PAM/kbdint vulnerability, but the details are publicly known. All\nof these vulnerabilities were corrected in OpenSSH 3.4.\nIn addition to the vulnerabilities fixes outlined above, our OpenSSH\npackages version 3.3 and higher support the new privilege separation\nfeature from Niels Provos, which changes ssh to use a separate\nnon-privileged process to handle most of the work. Vulnerabilities in\nthe unprivileged parts of OpenSSH will lead to compromise of an\nunprivileged account restricted to an empty chroot, rather than a\ndirect root compromise. Privilege separation should help to mitigate\nthe risks of any future OpenSSH compromise.\nDebian 2.2 (potato) shipped with an ssh package based on OpenSSH\n1.2.3, and is not vulnerable to the vulnerabilities covered by this\nadvisory. Users still running a version 1.2.3 ssh package do not have\nan immediate need to upgrade to OpenSSH 3.4. Users who upgraded to the\nOpenSSH version 3.3 packages released in previous iterations of\nDSA-134 should upgrade to the new version 3.4 OpenSSH packages, as the\nversion 3.3 packages are vulnerable. We suggest that users running\nOpenSSH 1.2.3 consider a move to OpenSSH 3.4 to take advantage of the\nprivilege separation feature. (Though, again, we have no specific\nknowledge of any vulnerability in OpenSSH 1.2.3. Please carefully read\nthe caveats listed below before upgrading from OpenSSH 1.2.3.) We\nrecommend that any users running a back-ported version of OpenSSH\nversion 2.0 or higher on potato move to OpenSSH 3.4.\nThe current pre-release version of Debian (woody) includes an OpenSSH\nversion 3.0.2p1 package (ssh), which is vulnerable to the PAM/kbdint\nproblem described above. We recommend that users upgrade to OpenSSH\n3.4 and enable privilege separation. Please carefully read the release\nnotes below before upgrading. Updated packages for ssh-krb5 (an\nOpenSSH package supporting kerberos authentication) are currently\nbeing developed. Users who cannot currently upgrade their OpenSSH\npackages may work around the known vulnerabilities by disabling the\nvulnerable features: make sure the following lines are uncommented and\npresent in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and restart ssh\nThere should be no other PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt or\nChallengeResponseAuthentication entries in sshd_config.\nThat concludes the vulnerability section of this advisory. What\nfollows are release notes related to the OpenSSH 3.4 package and the\nprivilege separation feature. URLs for the OpenSSH 3.4 packages are at\nthe bottom.\nSome notes on possible issues associated with this upgrade:\nSome issues from previous OpenSSH 3.3p1 packages corrected in this\nadvisory (not a complete changelog):\nAgain, we regret having to release packages with larger changes and\nless testing than is our usual practice; given the potential severity\nand non-specific nature of the original threat we decided that our users were\nbest served by having packages available for evaluation as quickly as\npossible. We will send additional information as it comes to us, and\nwill continue to work on the outstanding issues.\n"
