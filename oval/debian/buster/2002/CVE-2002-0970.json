      {
        "Family": "unix",

    "Description": "privacy escalation with Konqueror",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-155\nDue to a security engineering oversight, the SSL library from KDE,\nwhich Konqueror uses, doesn't check whether an intermediate\ncertificate for a connection is signed by the certificate authority as\nsafe for the purpose, but accepts it when it is signed.  This makes it\npossible for anyone with a valid VeriSign SSL site certificate to\nforge any other VeriSign SSL site certificate, and abuse Konqueror\nusers.\nA local root exploit using artsd has been discovered which exploited\nan insecure use of a format string.  The exploit wasn't working on a\nDebian system since artsd wasn't running setuid root.  Neither artsd\nnor artswrapper need to be setuid root anymore since current computer\nsystems are fast enough to handle the audio data in time.\nThese problems have been fixed in version 2.2.2-13.woody.2 for the\ncurrent stable distribution (woody).  The old stable\ndistribution (potato) is not affected, since it doesn't contain KDE\npackages.  The unstable distribution (sid) is not yet fixed, but new\npackages are expected in the future, the fixed version will be version\n2.2.2-14 or higher.\nWe recommend that you upgrade your kdelibs and libarts packages and\nrestart Konqueror.\n"
