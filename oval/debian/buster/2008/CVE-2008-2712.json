    "Description": "Vim 7.1.314, 6.4, and other versions allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via Vim scripts that do not properly sanitize inputs before invoking the execute or system functions, as demonstrated using (1) filetype.vim, (3) xpm.vim, (4) gzip_vim, and (5) netrw.  NOTE: the originally reported version was 7.1.314, but the researcher actually found this set of issues in 7.1.298.  NOTE: the zipplugin issue (originally vector 2 in this identifier) has been subsumed by CVE-2008-3075.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1733\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in vim, an enhanced vi editor.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\nJan Minar discovered that vim did not properly sanitise inputs\n    before invoking the execute or system functions inside vim\n    scripts. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nJan Minar discovered that the tar plugin of vim did not properly\n    sanitise the filenames in the tar archive or the name of the\n    archive file itself, making it prone to arbitrary code execution.\nJan Minar discovered that the zip plugin of vim did not properly\n    sanitise the filenames in the zip archive or the name of the\n    archive file itself, making it prone to arbitrary code execution.\nJan Minar discovered that the netrw plugin of vim did not properly\n    sanitise the filenames or directory names it is given. This could\n    lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nBen Schmidt discovered that vim did not properly escape characters\n    when performing keyword or tag lookups. This could lead to the\n    execution of arbitrary code.\n"
