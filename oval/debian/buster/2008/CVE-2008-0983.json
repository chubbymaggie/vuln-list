      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1609\nSeveral local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd,\na fast webserver with minimal memory footprint.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the \nfollowing problems:\nlighttpd 1.4.18, and possibly other versions before 1.5.0, does not\n  properly calculate the size of a file descriptor array, which allows \n  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large number \n  of connections, which triggers an out-of-bounds access. \nconnections.c in lighttpd before 1.4.16 might accept more connections \n  than the configured maximum, which allows remote attackers to cause a\n  denial of service (failed assertion) via a large number of connection\n  attempts.\n"
