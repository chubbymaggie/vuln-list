    "Description": "Multiple integer overflows in libc in NetBSD 4.x, FreeBSD 6.x and 7.x, and probably other BSD and Apple Mac OS platforms allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via large values of certain integer fields in the format argument to (1) the strfmon function in lib/libc/stdlib/strfmon.c, related to the GET_NUMBER macro; and (2) the printf function, related to left_prec and right_prec.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2058\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNU C Library (aka\nglibc) and its derivatives. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures \nproject identifies the following problems:\nMaksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the GNU C library did not\n    correctly handle integer overflows in the strfmon family of \n    functions. If a user or automated system were tricked into \n    processing a specially crafted format string, a remote attacker \n    could crash applications, leading to a denial of service.\nJeff Layton and Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did\n    not correctly handle newlines in the mntent family of functions. If\n    a local attacker were able to inject newlines into a mount entry \n    through other vulnerable mount helpers, they could disrupt the \n    system or possibly gain root privileges.\nDan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did not correctly\n    validate certain ELF program headers.  If a user or automated system\n    were tricked into verifying a specially crafted ELF program, a \n    remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges.\n"
