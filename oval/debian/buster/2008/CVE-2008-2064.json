      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1580\nIt was discovered that phpGedView, an application to provide online access\nto genealogical data, allowed remote attackers to gain administrator\nprivileges due to a programming error.\n\u003cem\u003eNote:\u003c/em\u003e this problem was a fundamental design flaw in the interface (API) to\nconnect phpGedView with external programs like content management systems.\nResolving this problem was only possible by completely reworking the API,\nwhich is not considered appropriate for a security update. Since these are\nperipheral functions probably not used by the large majority of package\nusers, it was decided to remove these interfaces. If you require that\ninterface nonetheless, you are advised to use a version of phpGedView\nbackported from Debian Lenny, which has a completely redesigned API.\n"
