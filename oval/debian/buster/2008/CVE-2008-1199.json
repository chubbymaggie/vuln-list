    "Description": "Dovecot before 1.0.11, when configured to use mail_extra_groups to allow Dovecot to create dotlocks in /var/mail, might allow local users to read sensitive mail files for other users, or modify files or directories that are writable by group, via a symlink attack.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1516\nPrior to this update, the default configuration for Dovecot used by\nDebian runs the server daemons with group mail privileges.  This means\nthat users with write access to their mail directory on the server\n(for example, through an SSH login) could read and also delete via a symbolic link mailboxes owned by\nother users for which they do not have direct access\n(\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1199\"\u003eCVE-2008-1199\u003c/a\u003e).  In addition, an internal interpretation conflict in\npassword handling has been addressed proactively, even though it is\nnot known to be exploitable (\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1218\"\u003eCVE-2008-1218\u003c/a\u003e).\nNote that applying this update requires manual action: The\nconfiguration setting \u003cq\u003email_extra_groups = mail\u003c/q\u003e has been replaced\nwith \u003cq\u003email_privileged_group = mail\u003c/q\u003e.  The update will show a\nconfiguration file conflict in /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.  It is\nrecommended that you keep the currently installed configuration file,\nand change the affected line.  For your reference, the sample\nconfiguration (without your local changes) will have been written to\n/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.dpkg-new.\nIf your current configuration uses \u003ccode\u003email_extra_groups\u003c/code\u003e with a value\ndifferent from \u003cq\u003email\u003c/q\u003e, you may have to resort to the\n\u003ccode\u003email_access_groups\u003c/code\u003e configuration directive.\n"
