    "Description": "The administration application in Django 0.91, 0.95, and 0.96 stores unauthenticated HTTP POST requests and processes them after successful authentication occurs, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and delete or modify data via unspecified requests.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1640\nSimon Willison discovered that in Django, a Python web framework, the\nfeature to retain HTTP POST data during user reauthentication allowed\na remote attacker to perform unauthorized modification of data through\ncross site request forgery. This is possible regardless of the Django\nplugin to prevent cross site request forgery being enabled. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this issue as\n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3909\"\u003eCVE-2008-3909\u003c/a\u003e.\nIn this update the affected feature is disabled; this is in accordance\nwith upstream's preferred solution for this situation.\nThis update takes the opportunity to also include a relatively minor\ndenial of service attack in the internationalisation framework, known\nas \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5712\"\u003eCVE-2007-5712\u003c/a\u003e.\n"
