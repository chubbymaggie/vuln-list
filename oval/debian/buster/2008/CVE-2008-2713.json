      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1616\nDamian Put discovered a vulnerability in the ClamAV anti-virus\ntoolkit's parsing of Petite-packed Win32 executables.  The weakness\nleads to an invalid memory access, and could enable an attacker to\ncrash clamav by supplying a maliciously crafted Petite-compressed\nbinary for scanning.  In some configurations, such as when clamav\nis used in combination with mail servers, this could cause a system\nto \u003cq\u003efail open\u003c/q\u003e, facilitating a follow-on viral attack.\nA previous version of this advisory referenced packages that were\nbuilt incorrectly and omitted the intended correction.  This\nissue was fixed in packages referenced by the -2 revision of the\nadvisory.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this\nweakness as \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2713\"\u003eCVE-2008-2713\u003c/a\u003e\nand \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3215\"\u003eCVE-2008-3215\u003c/a\u003e.\n"
