The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nAttackers with CREATE table permissions were allowed to read\n    arbitrary files readable by the webserver via a crafted\n    HTTP POST request.\nThe PHP session data file stored the username and password of\n    a logged in user, which in some setups can be read by a local\n    user.\nCross site scripting and SQL injection were possible by attackers\n    that had permission to create cookies in the same cookie domain\n    as phpMyAdmin runs in.\n"
