    "Description": "The DNS protocol, as implemented in (1) BIND 8 and 9 before 9.5.0-P1, 9.4.2-P1, and 9.3.5-P1; (2) Microsoft DNS in Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, and Server 2003 SP1 and SP2; and other implementations allow remote attackers to spoof DNS traffic via a birthday attack that uses in-bailiwick referrals to conduct cache poisoning against recursive resolvers, related to insufficient randomness of DNS transaction IDs and source ports, aka \"DNS Insufficient Socket Entropy Vulnerability\" or \"the Kaminsky bug.\"",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1623\nDan Kaminsky discovered that properties inherent to the DNS protocol\nlead to practical DNS cache poisoning attacks. Among other things,\nsuccessful attacks can lead to misdirected web traffic and email\nrerouting.\nThis update changes Debian's dnsmasq packages to implement the\nrecommended countermeasure: UDP query source port randomization. This\nchange increases the size of the space from which an attacker has to\nguess values in a backwards-compatible fashion and makes successful\nattacks significantly more difficult.\nThis update also switches the random number generator to Dan\nBernstein's SURF.\n"
