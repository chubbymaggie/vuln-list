      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1621\n\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Icedove\nmail client, an unbranded version of the Thunderbird client. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\n\n\n    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in MIME decoding can lead\n    to the execution of arbitrary code.\n    \n\n    It was discovered that missing boundary checks on a reference\n    counter for CSS objects can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n    \n\n    Devon Hubbard, Jesse Ruderman and Martijn Wargers discovered\n    crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of\n    arbitrary code.\n    \n\n    Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman and Gary Kwong discovered crashes in\n    the Javascript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n    \n\n    \"moz_bug_r_a4\" discovered that XUL documents can escalate\n    privileges by accessing the pre-compiled \"fastload\" file.\n    \n\n    \"moz_bug_r_a4\" discovered that missing input sanitising in the\n    mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript() function could lead to the\n    execution of arbitrary code. Iceweasel itself is not affected, but\n    some addons are.\n    \n\n    Daniel Glazman discovered that a programming error in the code for\n    parsing .properties files could lead to memory content being\n    exposed to addons, which could lead to information disclosure.\n    \n\n    John G. Myers, Frank Benkstein and Nils Toedtmann discovered that\n    alternate names on self-signed certificates were handled\n    insufficiently, which could lead to spoofings secure connections.\n    \n\n    Greg McManus discovered discovered a crash in the block reflow\n    code, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n    \n\nFor the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1.5.0.13+1.5.0.15b.dfsg1+prepatch080614d-0etch1.\nPackages for s390 are not yet available and will be provided later.\n\n\nFor the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.0.0.16-1.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your icedove package.\n\n"
