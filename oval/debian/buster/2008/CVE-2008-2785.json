      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1615\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a\nruntime environment for XUL applications. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nIt was discovered that missing boundary checks on a reference\n    counter for CSS objects can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nDevon Hubbard, Jesse Ruderman and Martijn Wargers discovered\n    crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of\n    arbitrary code.\nIgor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman and Gary Kwong discovered crashes in\n    the Javascript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\n\u003cq\u003emoz_bug_r_a4\u003c/q\u003e discovered several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.\nCollin Jackson and Adam Barth discovered that Javascript code\n    could be executed in the context of signed JAR archives.\n\u003cq\u003emoz_bug_r_a4\u003c/q\u003e discovered that XUL documents can escalate\n    privileges by accessing the pre-compiled \u003cq\u003efastload\u003c/q\u003e file.\n\u003cq\u003emoz_bug_r_a4\u003c/q\u003e discovered that missing input sanitising in the\n    mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript() function could lead to the\n    execution of arbitrary code. Iceweasel itself is not affected, but\n    some addons are.\nClaudio Santambrogio discovered that missing access validation in\n    DOM parsing allows malicious web sites to force the browser to\n    upload local files to the server, which could lead to information\n    disclosure.\nDaniel Glazman discovered that a programming error in the code for\n    parsing .properties files could lead to memory content being\n    exposed to addons, which could lead to information disclosure.\nMasahiro Yamada discovered that file URLs in directory listings\n    were insufficiently escaped.\nJohn G. Myers, Frank Benkstein and Nils Toedtmann discovered that\n    alternate names on self-signed certificates were handled\n    insufficiently, which could lead to spoofing of secure connections.\nGreg McManus discovered a crash in the block reflow\n    code, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.\nBilly Rios discovered that passing an URL containing a pipe symbol\n    to Iceweasel can lead to Chrome privilege escalation.\n"
