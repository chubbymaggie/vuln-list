    "Description": "Integer overflow in ClamAV 0.88.1 and 0.88.4, and other versions before 0.88.5, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (scanning service crash) and execute arbitrary code via a crafted Portable Executable (PE) file that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when less memory is allocated than expected.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1196\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ClamAV malware\nscan engine, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\nDamian Put discovered a heap overflow error in the script to rebuild\n    PE files, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nDamian Put discovered that missing input sanitising in the CHM\n    handling code might lead to denial of service.\n"
