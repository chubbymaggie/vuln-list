    "Description": "RIPd in Quagga 0.98 and 0.99 before 20060503 does not properly implement configurations that (1) disable RIPv1 or (2) require plaintext or MD5 authentication, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (routing state) via REQUEST packets such as SEND UPDATE.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1059\nKonstantin Gavrilenko discovered several vulnerabilities in quagga,\nthe BGP/OSPF/RIP routing daemon.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\nRemote attackers may obtain sensitive information via RIPv1\n    REQUEST packets even if the quagga has been configured to use MD5\n    authentication.\nRemote attackers could inject arbitrary routes using the RIPv1\n    RESPONSE packet even if the quagga has been configured to use MD5\n    authentication.\nFredrik Widell discovered that local users can cause a denial\n    of service in a certain sh ip bgp command entered in the telnet\n    interface.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain quagga packages.\n"
