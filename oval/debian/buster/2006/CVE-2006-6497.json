      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1265\nSeveral security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and\nderived products.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following vulnerabilities:\nSeveral vulnerabilities in the layout engine allow remote\n    attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly permit them to\n    execute arbitrary code. [MFSA 2006-68]\nSeveral vulnerabilities in the JavaScript engine allow remote\n    attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly permit them to\n    execute arbitrary code. [MFSA 2006-68]\nA bug in the js_dtoa function allows remote attackers to cause a\n    denial of service. [MFSA 2006-68]\n\u003cq\u003eshutdown\u003c/q\u003e discovered a vulnerability that allows remote attackers\n    to gain privileges and install malicious code via the watch\n    JavaScript function. [MFSA 2006-70]\nSteven Michaud discovered a programming bug that allows remote\n    attackers to cause a denial of service. [MFSA 2006-71]\n\u003cq\u003emoz_bug_r_a4\u003c/q\u003e reported that the src attribute of an IMG element\n    could be used to inject JavaScript code. [MFSA 2006-72]\nGeorgi Guninski discovered several heap-based buffer overflows\n    that allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. [MFSA 2006-74]\n"
