    "Description": "Integer overflow in FreeType before 2.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PCF file, as demonstrated by the Red Hat bad1.pcf test file, due to a partial fix of CVE-2006-1861.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1178\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow in freetype's PCF font code\nmay lead to denial of service and potential execution of arbitrary code.\nDSA-1193\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X Window System,\nwhich may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing problems:\nChris Evan discovered an integer overflow in the code to handle\n    PCF fonts, which might lead to denial of service if a malformed\n    font is opened.\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow in the code to handle\n    Adobe Font Metrics might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow in the code to handle\n    CMap and CIDFont font data might lead to the execution of arbitrary\n    code.\nThe XFree86 initialization code performs insufficient checking of\n    the return value of setuid() when dropping privileges, which might\n    lead to local privilege escalation.\n"
