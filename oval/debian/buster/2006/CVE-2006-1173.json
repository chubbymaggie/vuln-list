    "Description": "Sendmail before 8.13.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via deeply nested, malformed multipart MIME messages that exhaust the stack during the recursive mime8to7 function for performing 8-bit to 7-bit conversion, which prevents Sendmail from delivering queued messages and might lead to disk consumption by core dump files.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1155\nIt turned out that the sendmail binary depends on libsasl2 (\u0026gt;= 2.1.19.dfsg1)\nwhich is neither available in the stable nor in the security archive.\nThis version is scheduled for the inclusion in the next update of the\nstable release, though.\nYou'll have to download the referenced file for your architecture from\nbelow and install it with \u003ckbd\u003edpkg -i\u003c/kbd\u003e.\nAs an alternative, temporarily adding the following line to\n/etc/apt/sources.list will mitigate the problem as well:\nHere is the original security advisory for completeness:\nFrank Sheiness discovered that a MIME conversion routine in sendmail,\na powerful, efficient, and scalable mail transport agent, could be\ntricked by a specially crafted mail to perform an endless recursion.\n"
