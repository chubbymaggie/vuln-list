      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1044\nSeveral security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla\nFirefox.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following vulnerabilities:\nWeb pages with extremely long titles cause subsequent launches of\n    the browser to appear to \"hang\" for up to a few minutes, or even\n    crash if the computer has insufficient memory.  [MFSA-2006-03]\nThe JavaScript interpreter does not properly dereference objects,\n    which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or\n    execute arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-01]\nThe function allocation code allows attackers to cause a denial of\n    service and possibly execute arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-01]\nXULDocument.persist() did not validate the attribute name,\n    allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary XML and JavaScript code\n    into localstore.rdf that would be read and acted upon during\n    startup.  [MFSA-2006-05]\nAn anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero Day\n    Initiative reported that an invalid and nonsensical ordering of\n    table-related tags can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.\n    [MFSA-2006-27]\nA particular sequence of HTML tags can cause memory corruption\n    that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-18]\nGeorgi Guninski reported two variants of using scripts in an XBL\n    control to gain chrome privileges when the page is viewed under\n    \"Print Preview\".  [MFSA-2006-25]\n\"shutdown\" discovered that the crypto.generateCRMFRequest method\n    can be used to run arbitrary code with the privilege of the user\n    running the browser, which could enable an attacker to install\n    malware.  [MFSA-2006-24]\nClaus JĂ¸rgensen reported that a text input box can be pre-filled\n    with a filename and then turned into a file-upload control,\n    allowing a malicious website to steal any local file whose name\n    they can guess.  [MFSA-2006-23]\nAn anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero Day\n    Initiative discovered an integer overflow triggered by the CSS\n    letter-spacing property, which could be exploited to execute\n    arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-22]\n\"moz_bug_r_a4\" discovered that some internal functions return\n    prototypes instead of objects, which allows remote attackers to\n    conduct cross-site scripting attacks.  [MFSA-2006-19]\n\"shutdown\" discovered that it is possible to bypass same-origin\n    protections, allowing a malicious site to inject script into\n    content from another site, which could allow the malicious page to\n    steal information such as cookies or passwords from the other\n    site, or perform transactions on the user's behalf if the user\n    were already logged in.  [MFSA-2006-17]\n\"moz_bug_r_a4\" discovered that the compilation scope of privileged\n    built-in XBL bindings is not fully protected from web content and\n    can still be executed which could be used to execute arbitrary\n    JavaScript, which could allow an attacker to install malware such\n    as viruses and password sniffers.  [MFSA-2006-16]\n\"shutdown\" discovered that it is possible to access an internal\n    function object which could then be used to run arbitrary\n    JavaScript code with full permissions of the user running the\n    browser, which could be used to install spyware or viruses.\n    [MFSA-2006-15]\nIt is possible to create JavaScript functions that would get\n    compiled with the wrong privileges, allowing an attacker to run\n    code of their choice with full permissions of the user running the\n    browser, which could be used to install spyware or viruses.\n    [MFSA-2006-14]\nIt is possible to trick users into downloading and saving an\n    executable file via an image that is overlaid by a transparent\n    image link that points to the executable.  [MFSA-2006-13]\nAn integer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n    service and possibly execute arbitrary bytecode via JavaScript\n    with a large regular expression.  [MFSA-2006-11]\nAn unspecified vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a\n    denial of service.  [MFSA-2006-11]\nCertain Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can cause an out-of-bounds\n    array write and buffer overflow that could lead to a denial of\n    service and the possible execution of arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-11]\nIt is possible for remote attackers to spoof secure site\n    indicators such as the locked icon by opening the trusted site in\n    a popup window, then changing the location to a malicious site.\n    [MFSA-2006-12]\n\"shutdown\" discovered that it is possible to inject arbitrary\n    JavaScript code into a page on another site using a modal alert to\n    suspend an event handler while a new page is being loaded.  This\n    could be used to steal confidential information.  [MFSA-2006-09]\nIgor Bukanov discovered that the JavaScript engine does not\n    properly handle temporary variables, which might allow remote\n    attackers to trigger operations on freed memory and cause memory\n    corruption.  [MFSA-2006-10]\nA regression fix that could lead to memory corruption allows\n    remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute\n    arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-11]\n"
