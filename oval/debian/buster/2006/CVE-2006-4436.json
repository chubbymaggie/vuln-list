    "Description": "isakmpd in OpenBSD 3.8, 3.9, and possibly earlier versions, creates Security Associations (SA) with a replay window of size 0 when isakmpd acts as a responder during SA negotiation, which allows remote attackers to replay IPSec packets and bypass the replay protection.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1175\nA flaw has been found in isakmpd, OpenBSD's implementation of the\nInternet Key Exchange protocol, that caused Security Associations to be\ncreated with a replay window of 0 when isakmpd was acting as the\nresponder during SA negotiation.  This could allow an attacker to\nre-inject sniffed IPsec packets, which would not be checked against the\nreplay counter.\n"
