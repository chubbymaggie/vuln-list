      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-999\nSeveral security related problems have been discovered in lurker, an\narchive tool for mailing lists with integrated search engine.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\nLurker's mechanism for specifying configuration files was\n    vulnerable to being overridden.  As lurker includes sections of\n    unparsed config files in its output, an attacker could manipulate\n    lurker into reading any file readable by the www-data user.\nIt is possible for a remote attacker to create or overwrite files\n    in any writable directory that is named \"mbox\".\nMissing input sanitising allows an attacker to inject arbitrary\n    web script or HTML.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain lurker packages.\n"
