    "Description": "unix_random.c in lshd for lsh 2.0.1 leaks file descriptors related to the randomness generator, which allows local users to cause a denial of service by truncating the seed file, which prevents the server from starting, or obtain sensitive seed information that could be used to crack keys.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-956\nStefan Pfetzing discovered that lshd, a Secure Shell v2 (SSH2)\nprotocol server, leaks a couple of file descriptors, related to the\nrandomness generator, to user shells which are started by lshd.  A\nlocal attacker can truncate the server's seed file, which may prevent\nthe server from starting, and with some more effort, maybe also crack\nsession keys.\nAfter applying this update, you should remove the server's seed file\n(/var/spool/lsh/yarrow-seed-file) and then regenerate it with\n\"lsh-make-seed --server\" as root.\nFor security reasons, lsh-make-seed really needs to be run from the\nconsole of the system you are running it on.  If you run lsh-make-seed\nusing a remote shell, the timing information lsh-make-seed uses for\nits random seed creation is likely to be screwed.  If need be, you can\ngenerate the random seed on a different system than that which it will\neventually be on, by installing the lsh-utils package and running\n\"lsh-make-seed -o my-other-server-seed-file\".  You may then transfer\nthe seed to the destination system as using a secure connection.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) may not be affected by this problem.\n"
