      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1104\nLoading malformed XML documents can cause buffer overflows in\nOpenOffice.org, a free office suite, and cause a denial of service or\nexecute arbitrary code. Â It turned out that the correction in DSA\n1104-1 was not sufficient, hence, another update. For completeness\nplease find the original advisory text below:\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenOffice.org, a free\noffice suite.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project\nidentifies the following problems:\nIt turned out to be possible to embed arbitrary BASIC macros in\n    documents in a way that OpenOffice.org does not see them but\n    executes them anyway without any user interaction.\nIt is possible to evade the Java sandbox with specially crafted\n    Java applets.\nLoading malformed XML documents can cause buffer overflows and\n    cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.\nThis update has the Mozilla component disabled, so that the\nMozilla/LDAP addressbook feature won't work anymore.  It didn't work on\nanything else than i386 on sarge either.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain OpenOffice.org\npackages.\n"
