The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nPrivate messaging allowed cross site request forgery, making\n\tit possible to delete all private messages of a user by sending\n\tthem to a crafted web page.\nCross site request forgery enabled an attacker to perform various\n\tactions on behalf of a logged in user. (Applies to sarge only.)\nA negative start parameter could allow an attacker to create\n\tinvalid output. (Applies to sarge only.)\nRedirection targets were not fully checked, leaving room for\n\tunauthorised external redirections via a phpBB forum.\n\t(Applies to sarge only.)\nAn authenticated forum administrator may upload files of any\n\ttype by using specially crafted filenames.
