    "Description": "OpenSSL 0.9.7 before 0.9.7l, 0.9.8 before 0.9.8d, and earlier versions allows attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via parasitic public keys with large (1) \"public exponent\" or (2) \"public modulus\" values in X.509 certificates that require extra time to process when using RSA signature verification.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1185\nThe fix used to correct CVE-2006-2940 introduced code that could lead to\nthe use of uninitialized memory.  Such use is likely to cause the\napplication using the openssl library to crash, and has the potential to\nallow an attacker to cause the execution of arbitrary code.\nFor reference please find below the original advisory text:\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the OpenSSL\ncryptographic software package that could allow an attacker to launch\na denial of service attack by exhausting system resources or crashing\nprocesses on a victim's computer.\nDr S N Henson of the OpenSSL core team and Open Network\n\tSecurity recently developed an ASN1 test suite for NISCC\n\t(www.niscc.gov.uk). When the test suite was run against\n\tOpenSSL two denial of service vulnerabilities were discovered.\nDuring the parsing of certain invalid ASN1 structures an error\n\tcondition is mishandled. This can result in an infinite loop\n\twhich consumes system memory.\nAny code which uses OpenSSL to parse ASN1 data from untrusted\n\tsources is affected. This includes SSL servers which enable\n\tclient authentication and S/MIME applications.\nTavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team\n\tdiscovered a buffer overflow in SSL_get_shared_ciphers utility\n\tfunction, used by some applications such as exim and mysql.  An\n\tattacker could send a list of ciphers that would overrun a\n\tbuffer.\nTavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team\n\tdiscovered a possible DoS in the sslv2 client code.  Where a\n\tclient application uses OpenSSL to make a SSLv2 connection to\n\ta malicious server that server could cause the client to\n\tcrash.\nDr S N Henson of the OpenSSL core team and Open Network\n\tSecurity recently developed an ASN1 test suite for NISCC\n\t(www.niscc.gov.uk). When the test suite was run against\n\tOpenSSL a DoS was discovered.\nCertain types of public key can take disproportionate amounts\n\tof time to process. This could be used by an attacker in a\n\tdenial of service attack.\n"
