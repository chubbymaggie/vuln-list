    "Description": "flex.skl in Will Estes and John Millaway Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator (flex) before 2.5.33 does not allocate enough memory for grammars containing (1) REJECT statements or (2) trailing context rules, which causes flex to generate code that contains a buffer overflow that might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1020\nChris Moore discovered that flex, a scanner generator, generates code,\nwhich allocates insufficient memory, if the grammar contains REJECT\nstatements or trailing context rules. This may lead to a buffer overflow\nand the execution of arbitrary code.\nIf you use code, which is derived from a vulnerable lex grammar in\nan untrusted environment you need to regenerate your scanner with the\nfixed version of flex.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.\n"
