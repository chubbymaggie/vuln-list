    "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the sreplace function in ProFTPD 1.3.0 and earlier allows remote attackers, probably authenticated, to cause a denial of service and execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated by vd_proftpd.pm, a \"ProFTPD remote exploit.\"",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1222\nDue to technical problems yesterday's proftpd update lacked a build for\nthe amd64 architecture, which is now available. For reference please find\nbelow the original advisory text:\nSeveral remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the proftpd FTP\ndaemon, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial\nof service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow in the \u003ccode\u003esreplace()\u003c/code\u003e function\n    may lead to denial of service and possibly the execution of arbitrary\n    code.\nIt was discovered that a buffer overflow in the mod_tls addon module\n    may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nIt was discovered that insufficient validation of FTP command buffer\n    size limits may lead to denial of service. Due to unclear information\n    this issue was already fixed in \u003ca href=\"dsa-1218\"\u003eDSA-1218\u003c/a\u003e as \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5815\"\u003eCVE-2006-5815\u003c/a\u003e.\n"
