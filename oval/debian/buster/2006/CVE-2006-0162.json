    "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in libclamav/upx.c in Clam Antivirus (ClamAV) before 0.88 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted UPX files.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-947\nA heap overflow has been discovered in ClamAV, a virus scanner, which\ncould allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending a carefully\ncrafted UPX-encoded executable to a system running ClamAV. In addition,\nother potential overflows have been corrected.\nPackages for the ARM architecture were not available when DSA 947-1 was\nreleased; these packages are now available. Also, DSA 947-1 incorrectly\nidentified the package version which corrected these issues in the\nunstable distribution (sid).\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not include ClamAV.\n"
