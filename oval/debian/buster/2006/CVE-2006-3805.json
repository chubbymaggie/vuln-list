    "Description": "The Javascript engine in Mozilla Firefox before 1.5.0.5, Thunderbird before 1.5.0.5, and SeaMonkey before 1.0.3 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving garbage collection that causes deletion of a temporary object that is still being used.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1161\nThe latest security updates of Mozilla Firefox introduced a regression\nthat led to a dysfunctional attachment panel which warrants a\ncorrection to fix this issue. For reference please find below the\noriginal advisory text:\nSeveral security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and\nderived products like Mozilla Firefox.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:\nThe Javascript engine might allow remote attackers to execute\n    arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-50]\nMultiple integer overflows in the Javascript engine might allow\n    remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-50]\nSpecially crafted Javascript allows remote attackers to execute\n    arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-51]\nRemote Proxy AutoConfig (PAC) servers could execute code with elevated\n    privileges via a specially crafted PAC script.  [MFSA-2006-52]\nScripts with the UniversalBrowserRead privilege could gain\n    UniversalXPConnect privileges and possibly execute code or obtain\n    sensitive data.  [MFSA-2006-53]\nMultiple vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to cause a denial\n    of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code.\n    [MFSA-2006-55]\n"
