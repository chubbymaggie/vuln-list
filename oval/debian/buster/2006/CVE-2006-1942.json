The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nvulnerabilities:\nEric Foley discovered that a user can be tricked to expose a local\n    file to a remote attacker by displaying a local file as image in\n    connection with other vulnerabilities.  [MFSA-2006-39]\nXUL attributes are associated with the wrong URL under certain\n    circumstances, which might allow remote attackers to bypass\n    restrictions.  [MFSA-2006-35]\nPaul Nickerson discovered that content-defined setters on an\n    object prototype were getting called by privileged user interface\n    code, and \"moz_bug_r_a4\" demonstrated that the higher privilege\n    level could be passed along to the content-defined attack code.\n    [MFSA-2006-37]\nA vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code\n    and create notifications that are executed in a privileged\n    context.  [MFSA-2006-43]\nMikolaj Habryn discovered a buffer overflow in the crypto.signText function\n    that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain\n    optional Certificate Authority name arguments.  [MFSA-2006-38]\nMozilla team members discovered several crashes during testing of\n    the browser engine showing evidence of memory corruption which may\n    also lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

[MFSA-2006-32]\nAn integer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n    service and may permit the execution of arbitrary code.\n    [MFSA-2006-32]\nMasatoshi Kimura discovered a double-free vulnerability that\n    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly\n    execute arbitrary code via a VCard.
