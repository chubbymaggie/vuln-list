    "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the ps_gettext function in ps.c for GNU gv 3.6.2, and possibly earlier versions, allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a PostScript (PS) file with certain headers that contain long comments, as demonstrated using the (1) DocumentMedia, (2) DocumentPaperSizes, and possibly (3) PageMedia and (4) PaperSize headers.  NOTE: this issue can be exploited through other products that use gv such as evince.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1243\nRenaud Lifchitz discovered that gv, the PostScript and PDF viewer for X,\nperforms insufficient boundary checks in the Postscript parsing code,\nwhich allows the execution of arbitrary code through a buffer overflow.\nEvince embeds a copy of gv and needs an update as well.\nDSA-1214\nThe original update provided in DSA 1214-1 was insufficient; this update\ncorrects this. For reference please find the original advisory text below:\n\nRenaud Lifchitz discovered that gv, the PostScript and PDF viewer for X,\nperforms insufficient boundary checks in the Postscript parsing code,\nwhich allows the execution of arbitrary code through a buffer overflow.\n"
