The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\nThe OLE2 unpacker allows remote attackers to cause a segmentation\n    fault via a DOC file with an invalid property tree, which triggers\n    an infinite recursion.\nA specially crafted executable compressed with FSG 1.33 could\n    cause the extractor to write beyond buffer boundaries, allowing an\n    attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nA specially crafted CAB file could cause ClamAV to be locked in an\n    infinite loop and use all available processor resources, resulting\n    in a denial of service.\nA specially crafted CAB file could cause ClamAV to be locked in an\n    infinite loop and use all available processor resources, resulting\n    in a denial of service.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain clamav packages.\n"
