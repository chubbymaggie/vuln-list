    "Description": "Buffer overflow in the POP3 client in Fetchmail before 6.2.5.2 allows remote POP3 servers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via long UIDL responses.  NOTE: a typo in an advisory accidentally used the wrong CVE identifier for the Fetchmail issue. This is the correct identifier.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-774\nEdward Shornock discovered a bug in the UIDL handling code of\nfetchmail, a common POP3, APOP and IMAP mail fetching utility.  A\nmalicious POP3 server could exploit this problem and inject arbitrary\ncode that will be executed on the victim host.  If fetchmail is\nrunning as root, this becomes a root exploit.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.\n"
