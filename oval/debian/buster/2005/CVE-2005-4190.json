The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nSeveral Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in\n    the \"share edit window\".\nNull characters in the URL parameter bypass a sanity check, which\n    allowed remote attackers to read arbitrary files, which allowed\n    information disclosure.\nUser input in the help viewer was passed unsanitised to the eval()\n    function, which allowed injection of arbitrary web code.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) doesn't contain horde3 packages.\n"
