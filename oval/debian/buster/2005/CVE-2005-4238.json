      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-944\nSeveral security related problems have been discovered in Mantis, a\nweb-based bug tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\nMissing input sanitising allows remote attackers  to inject\n    arbitrary web script or HTML.\nTobias Klein discovered that Mantis allows remote attackers to\n    bypass the file upload size restriction.\nTobias Klein discovered several SQL injection vulnerabilities that\n    allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.\nTobias Klein discovered unspecified \"port injection\"\n    vulnerabilities in filters.\nTobias Klein discovered a CRLF injection vulnerability that allows\n    remote attackers to modify HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response\n    splitting attacks.\nTobias Klein discovered several cross-site scripting (XSS)\n    vulnerabilities that allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary\n    web script or HTML.\nTobias Klein discovered that Mantis discloses private bugs via\n    public RSS feeds, which allows remote attackers to obtain\n    sensitive information.\nTobias Klein discovered that Mantis does not properly handle \"Make\n    note private\" when a bug is being resolved, which has unknown\n    impact and attack vectors, probably related to an information\n    leak.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by\nthese problems.\n"
