    "Description": "The Linux 2.4 kernel patch in kernel-patch-vserver before 1.9.5.5 and 2.x before 2.3 for Debian GNU/Linux does not correctly set the \"chroot barrier\" with util-vserver, which allows attackers to access files on the host system that are outside of the vserver.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1011\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Debian vserver\nsupport for Linux.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nBjĂ¸rn Steinbrink discovered that the chroot barrier is not set\n    correctly with util-vserver which may result in unauthorised\n    escapes from a vserver to the host system.\nThis vulnerability is limited to the 2.4 kernel patch included in\n    kernel-patch-vserver.  The correction to this problem requires\n    updating the util-vserver package as well and installing a new\n    kernel built from the updated kernel-patch-vserver package.\nThe default policy of util-vserver is set to trust all unknown\n    capabilities instead of considering them as insecure.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain a\nkernel-patch-vserver package.\n"
