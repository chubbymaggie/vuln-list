      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-779\nWe experienced that the update for Mozilla Firefox from DSA 779-1\nunfortunately was a regression in several cases. Â Since the usual\npraxis of backporting apparently does not work, this update is\nbasically version 1.0.6 with the version number rolled back, and hence\nstill named 1.0.4-*. Â For completeness below is the original advisory\ntext:\nSeveral problems have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox, a\nlightweight web browser based on Mozilla.  The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nThe browser user interface does not properly distinguish between\n    user-generated events and untrusted synthetic events, which makes\n    it easier for remote attackers to perform dangerous actions that\n    normally could only be performed manually by the user.\nXML scripts ran even when Javascript disabled.\nThe user can be tricked to executing arbitrary JavaScript code by\n    using a JavaScript URL as wallpaper.\nIt is possible for a remote attacker to execute a callback\n    function in the context of another domain (i.e. frame).\nBy opening a malicious link in the sidebar it is possible for\n    remote attackers to steal sensitive information.\nMissing input sanitising of InstallVersion.compareTo() can cause\n    the application to crash.\nRemote attackers could steal sensitive information such as cookies\n    and passwords from web sites by accessing data in alien frames.\nBy using standalone applications such as Flash and QuickTime to\n    open a javascript: URL, it is possible for a remote attacker to\n    steal sensitive information and possibly execute arbitrary code.\nIt is possible for a Javascript dialog box to spoof a dialog box\n    from a trusted site and facilitates phishing attacks.\nRemote attackers could modify certain tag properties of DOM nodes\n    that could lead to the execution of arbitrary script or code.\nThe Mozilla browser family does not properly clone base objects,\n    which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.\n"
