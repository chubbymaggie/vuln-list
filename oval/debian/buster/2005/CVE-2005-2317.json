    "Description": "Shorewall 2.4.x before 2.4.1, 2.2.x before 2.2.5, and 2.0.x before 2.0.17, when MACLIST_TTL is greater than 0 or MACLIST_DISPOSITION is set to ACCEPT, allows remote attackers with an accepted MAC address to bypass other firewall rules or policies.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-849\n\"Supernaut\" noticed that shorewall, the Shoreline Firewall, could\ngenerate an iptables configuration which is significantly more\npermissive than the rule set given in the shorewall configuration, if\nMAC verification are used in a non-default manner.\nWhen MACLIST_DISPOSITION is set to ACCEPT in the shorewall.conf file,\nall packets from hosts which fail the MAC verification pass through\nthe firewall, without further checks.  When MACLIST_TTL is set to a\nnon-zero value, packets from hosts which pass the MAC verification\npass through the firewall, again without further checks.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.\n"
