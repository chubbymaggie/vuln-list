The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nEric Romang discovered that the ARC archive program under Unix\n    creates a temporary file with insecure permissions which may lead\n    to an attacker stealing sensitive information.\nJoey Schulze discovered that the temporary file was created in an\n    insecure fashion as well, leaving it open to a classic symlink\n    attack.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain arc packages.\n"
