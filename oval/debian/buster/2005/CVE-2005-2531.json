    "Description": "OpenVPN before 2.0.1, when running with \"verb 0\" and without TLS authentication, does not properly flush the OpenSSL error queue when a client fails certificate authentication to the server and causes the error to be processed by the wrong client, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client disconnection) via a large number of failed authentication attempts.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-851\nSeveral security related problems have been discovered in openvpn, a\nVirtual Private Network daemon.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\nWrong processing of failed certificate authentication when running\n    with \"verb 0\" and without TLS authentication can lead to a denial\n    of service by disconnecting the wrong client.\nWrong handling of packets that can't be decrypted on the server\n    can lead to the disconnection of unrelated clients.\nWhen running in \"dev tap\" Ethernet bridging mode, openvpn can\n    exhaust its memory by receiving a large number of spoofed MAC\n    addresses and hence denying service.\nSimultaneous TCP connections from multiple clients with the same\n    client certificate can cause a denial of service when\n    \u003ccode\u003e--duplicate-cn\u003c/code\u003e is not enabled.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain openvpn packages.\n"
