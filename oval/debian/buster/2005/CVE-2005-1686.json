    "Description": "Format string vulnerability in gedit 2.10.2 may allow attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a bin file with format string specifiers in the filename.  NOTE: while this issue is triggered on the command line by the gedit user, it has been reported that web browsers and email clients could be configured to provide a file name as an argument to gedit, so there is a valid attack that crosses security boundaries.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-753\nA format string vulnerability has been discovered in gedit, a\nlight-weight text editor for GNOME, that may allow attackers to cause\na denial of service (application crash) via a binary file with format\nstring specifiers in the filename.  Since gedit supports opening files\nvia \"http://\" URLs (through GNOME vfs) and other schemes, this might\nbe a remotely exploitable vulnerability.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) is not vulnerable to this problem.\n"
