      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-757\nDaniel Wachdorf reported two problems in the MIT krb5 distribution used\nfor network authentication. First, the KDC program from the krb5-kdc\npackage can corrupt the heap by trying to free memory which has already\nbeen freed on receipt of a certain TCP connection. This vulnerability\ncan cause the KDC to crash, leading to a denial of service.\n[\u003ca href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1174\"\u003eCAN-2005-1174\u003c/a\u003e] Second, under certain rare circumstances this type of\nrequest can lead to a buffer overflow and remote code execution.\n[\u003ca href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1175\"\u003eCAN-2005-1175\u003c/a\u003e] \nAdditionally, Magnus Hagander reported another problem in which the\nkrb5_recvauth function can in certain circumstances free previously\nfreed memory, potentially leading to the execution of remote code.\n[\u003ca href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1689\"\u003eCAN-2005-1689\u003c/a\u003e] \nAll of these vulnerabilities are believed difficult to exploit, and no\nexploits have yet been discovered.\n"
