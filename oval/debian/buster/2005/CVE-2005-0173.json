      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-667\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid, the internet\nobject cache, the popular WWW proxy cache.  The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:\nLDAP is very forgiving about spaces in search filters and this\n    could be abused to log in using several variants of the login\n    name, possibly bypassing explicit access controls or confusing\n    accounting.\nCache pollution/poisoning via HTTP response splitting has been\n    discovered.\nThe meaning of the access controls becomes somewhat confusing if\n    any of the referenced ACLs (access control lists) is declared\n    empty, without any members.\nThe length argument of the WCCP recvfrom() call is larger than it\n    should be.  An attacker may send a larger than normal WCCP packet\n    that could overflow a buffer.\n"
