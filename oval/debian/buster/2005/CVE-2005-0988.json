    "Description": "Race condition in gzip 1.2.4, 1.3.3, and earlier, when decompressing a gzipped file, allows local users to modify permissions of arbitrary files via a hard link attack on a file while it is being decompressed, whose permissions are changed by gzip after the decompression is complete.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-752\nTwo problems have been discovered in gzip, the GNU compression\nutility.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems.\nImran Ghory discovered a race condition in the permissions setting\n    code in gzip.  When decompressing a file in a directory an\n    attacker has access to, gunzip could be tricked to set the file\n    permissions to a different file the user has permissions to.\nUlf HĂ¤rnhammar discovered a path traversal vulnerability in\n    gunzip.  When gunzip is used with the -N option an attacker could\n    use\n    this vulnerability to create files in an arbitrary directory with\n    the permissions of the user.\n"
