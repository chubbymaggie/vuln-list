    "Description": "The Apache HTTP server before 1.3.34, and 2.0.x before 2.0.55, when acting as an HTTP proxy, allows remote attackers to poison the web cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct XSS attacks via an HTTP request with both a \"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\" header and a Content-Length header, which causes Apache to incorrectly handle and forward the body of the request in a way that causes the receiving server to process it as a separate HTTP request, aka \"HTTP Request Smuggling.\"",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-803\nA vulnerability has been discovered in the Apache web server.  When it\nis acting as an HTTP proxy, it allows remote attackers to poison the\nweb cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct\ncross-site scripting attacks, which causes Apache to incorrectly\nhandle and forward the body of the request.\nThe fix for this bug is contained in the apache-common package which means\nthat there isn't any need for a separate update of the apache-perl and\napache-ssl package.\n"
