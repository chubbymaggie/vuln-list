    "Description": "fetchmailconf before 1.49 in fetchmail 6.2.0, 6.2.5 and 6.2.5.2 creates configuration files with insecure world-readable permissions, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information such as passwords.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-900\nDue to restrictive dependency definition for fetchmail-ssl the updated fetchmailconf\npackage couldn't be installed on the old stable distribution (woody)\ntogether with fetchmail-ssl. Â Hence, this update loosens it, so that\nthe update can be pulled in. Â For completeness we're including the\noriginal advisory text:\nThomas Wolff discovered that the fetchmailconf program which is\nprovided as part of fetchmail, an SSL enabled POP3, APOP, IMAP mail\ngatherer/forwarder, creates the new configuration in an insecure\nfashion that can lead to leaking passwords for mail accounts to local\nusers.\nThis update also fixes a regression in the package for stable caused\nby the last security update.\n"
