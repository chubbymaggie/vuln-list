    "Description": "Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in sudo 1.6.8 and earlier allows local users to gain privileges via the (1) SHELLOPTS and (2) PS4 environment variables before executing a bash script on behalf of another user, which are not cleared even though other variables are.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-870\nTavis Ormandy noticed that sudo, a program that provides limited super\nuser privileges to specific users, does not clean the environment\nsufficiently.  The SHELLOPTS and PS4 variables are dangerous and are\nstill passed through to the program running as privileged user.  This\ncan result in the execution of arbitrary commands as privileged user\nwhen a bash script is executed.  These vulnerabilities can only be\nexploited by users who have been granted limited super user\nprivileges.\n"
