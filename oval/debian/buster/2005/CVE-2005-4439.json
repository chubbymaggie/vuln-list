    "Description": "Buffer overflow in ELOG elogd 2.6.0-beta4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a URL with a long (1) cmd or (2) mode parameter.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-967\nSeveral security problems have been found in elog, an electronic logbook\nto manage notes.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project\nidentifies the following problems:\n\"GroundZero Security\" discovered that elog insufficiently checks the\n    size of a buffer used for processing URL parameters, which might lead\n    to the execution of arbitrary code.\nIt was discovered that elog contains a directory traversal vulnerability\n    in the processing of \"../\" sequences in URLs, which might lead to\n    information disclosure.\nThe code to write the log file contained a format string vulnerability,\n    which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nOverly long revision attributes might trigger a crash due to a buffer\n    overflow.\nThe code to write the log file does not enforce bounds checks properly,\n    which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nelog emitted different errors messages for invalid passwords and invalid\n    users, which allows an attacker to probe for valid user names.\nAn attacker could be driven into infinite redirection with a crafted\n    \"fail\" request, which has denial of service potential.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain elog packages.\n"
