    "Description": "Format string vulnerability in the SetImageInfo function in image.c for ImageMagick before 6.0.2.5 may allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in a filename argument to convert, which may be called by other web applications.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-702\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in ImageMagick, a\ncommonly used image manipulation library.  These problems can be\nexploited by a carefully crafted graphic image.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\nTavis Ormandy discovered a format string vulnerability in the\n    filename handling code which allows a remote attacker to cause a\n    denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.\nAndrei Nigmatulin discovered a denial of service condition which\n    can be caused by an invalid tag in a TIFF image.\nAndrei Nigmatulin discovered that the TIFF decoder is vulnerable\n    to accessing memory out of bounds which will result in a\n    segmentation fault.\nAndrei Nigmatulin discovered a buffer overflow in the SGI parser\n    which allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a\n    specially crafted SGI image file.\n"
