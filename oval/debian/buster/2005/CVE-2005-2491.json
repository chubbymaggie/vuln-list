    "Description": "Integer overflow in pcre_compile.c in Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) before 6.2, as used in multiple products such as Python, Ethereal, and PHP, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via quantifier values in regular expressions, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-800\nAn integer overflow with subsequent buffer overflow has been detected\nin PCRE, the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library, which allows\nan attacker to execute arbitrary code.\nSince several packages link dynamically to this library you are\nadvised to restart the corresponding services or programs\nrespectively.  The command \u0026ldquo;apt-cache showpkg libpcre3\u0026rdquo; will list\nthe corresponding packages in the \"Reverse Depends:\" section.\nDSA-819\nAn integer overflow with a subsequent buffer overflow has been detected\nin PCRE, the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library, which allows\nan attacker to execute arbitrary code, and is also present in Python.\nExploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to specify the used\nregular expression.\nDSA-821\nAn integer overflow with a subsequent buffer overflow has been detected\nin PCRE, the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library, which allows\nan attacker to execute arbitrary code, and is also present in Python.\nExploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to specify the used\nregular expression.\nThe old stable distribution (woody) does not contain python2.3 packages.\nDSA-817\nAn integer overflow with a subsequent buffer overflow has been detected\nin PCRE, the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library, which allows\nan attacker to execute arbitrary code, and is also present in Python.\nExploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to specify the used\nregular expression.\n"
