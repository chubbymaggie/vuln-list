    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A privilege escalation flaw was found in Tomcat when the JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener was enabled. A local attacker without access to the Tomcat process or configuration files could be able to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker could then capture user names and passwords used to access the JMX interface and gain complete control over the Tomcat instance.\n            STATEMENT: This flaw did not affect the versions of tomcat as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, as they did not include JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener, which was introduced in a later version of the package.\n            MITIGATION: Disable JMX Remote if monitoring is only needed locally and there is no need to monitor Tomcat remotely. If JMX Remote is required and cannot be disabled, then use the built-in remote JMX facilities provided by the JVM.\nPlease note that JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener is now deprecated and may be removed from both Tomcat 7 [1] and Tomcat 9 [2] after 2020-12-31.\n\n[1] https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/listeners.html#Deprecated_Implementations\n[2] https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/config/listeners.html#Deprecated_Implementations",
