    "Description": "STATEMENT: This flaw has a lower impact on Red Hat Enterprise Linux because the ntfs-3g tool is run in a supermin appliance, which is similar to a virtual machine instantiated on the fly, and it does not have the SUID bit set. Thus an attacker is very limited on what he can do to the vulnerable system.",
