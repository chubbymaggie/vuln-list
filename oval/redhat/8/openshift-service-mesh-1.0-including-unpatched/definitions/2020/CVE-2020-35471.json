    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A null pointer dereference vulnerability was found in envoy. During the handling of truncated or dropped UDP datagrams, a potential attacker could specify the length of the packet to be larger than 1500 bytes and cause the envoy proxy process to sedfault resulting in a denial of service.\n            STATEMENT: Whilst OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) does package a vulnerable version of envoy, it does not implement the UDP proxy. Hence it has been assessed with a Low impact, wontfix and might be addressed in a future release.",
