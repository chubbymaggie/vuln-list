    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An HTTP-interpretation flaw was found in waitress which did not properly validate incoming HTTP headers. When parsing the Transfer-Encoding header, waitress would look only for a single string value. According to the HTTP standard, Transfer-Encoding should be a comma-separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending with 'chunked'. Because of this flaw, requests sent with: \"Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked\" would get ignored, and waitress would use the Content-Length header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to force waitress to accept potentially bad HTTP requests or treat a single request as multiple requests in the case of HTTP pipelining.\n            STATEMENT: All affected Red Hat products ship but do not use the flawed version of python-waitress. The impact for these products is therefore rated as having a security impact of Low.",
