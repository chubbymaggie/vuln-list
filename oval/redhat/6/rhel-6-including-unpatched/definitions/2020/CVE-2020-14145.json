    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in OpenSSH in versions 5.7 through 8.3, where an Observable Discrepancy occurs and leads to an information leak in the algorithm negotiation. This flaw allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to target initial connection attempts, where there is no host key for the server that has been cached by the client.\n            STATEMENT: This attack is only feasible when connecting to a malicious man-in-the-middle SSH servers, whose host keys have not been verified by the ssh client side users. The attacker can only detect if the client is using a host key from its key store or new host key has been presented to it. Therefore does not present a real world attack scenario.\n            MITIGATION: Always connect to SSH servers with verified host keys to avoid any possibilities of man-in-the-middle attack.",
