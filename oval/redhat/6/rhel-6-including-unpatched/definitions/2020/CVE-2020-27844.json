    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in openjpeg's src/lib/openjp2/t2.c. This flaw allows an attacker to provide crafted input to openjpeg during conversion and encoding, causing an out-of-bounds write. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n            \n            MITIGATION: This flaw can be mitigated by not converting or encoding untrusted input data using openjpeg. For example, just reading a file with openjpeg does not trigger the flaw. Additionally, the fortify protection limits the degree of exploitation that the flaw could be used to achieve.",
