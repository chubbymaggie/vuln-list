    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: There's a flaw in openjpeg in src/lib/openjp2/pi.c. When an attacker is able to provide crafted input to be processed by the openjpeg encoder, this could cause an out-of-bounds read. The greatest impact from this flaw is to application availability.\n            STATEMENT: This issue does not affect openjpeg2 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 because the affected functionality was introduced in the current master but is absent from the shipped release.\n            MITIGATION: This flaw could be mitigated if openjpeg is not used for converting or encoding images, or untrusted input is not provided for these functions.",
