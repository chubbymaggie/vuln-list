    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in cairo's image-compositor.c. An attacker who is able to provide a crafted input file to cairo's image-compositor (e.g. by convincing a user to open a file in an application using cairo, or if an application uses cairo on untrusted input) could cause a stack buffer overflow -\u003e out-of-bounds WRITE. The highest impact of this flaw could affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n            STATEMENT: Libreoffice as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 is not affected by this flaw as it was introduced in a newer version. Also note that while the flaw was originally discovered via Libreoffice, the root cause is in the cairo graphics library. This flaw has an adjusted CVSS score for cairo as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 because cairo is built with binary protections which limit the impact.",
