    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: Setup in Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux added /sbin/nologin and /usr/sbin/nologin to /etc/shells. This violates security assumptions made by pam_shells and some daemons which allow access based on a user's shell being listed in /etc/shells.  Under some circumstances, users which had their shell changed to /sbin/nologin could still access the system.\n            STATEMENT: Preventing a user from accessing the system without deleting their account is not a simple matter. For utmost security, the account should be deleted. Short of this, we recommend a three-pronged approach:\n * change the user's login shell to a harmless command that is not in \"/etc/shells\" (for example \"/bin/false\") to prevent commands being run on their behalf\n * lock the user's password with \"usermod -L\" to prevent authentication with pam services\n * prevent access to the user's home directory with \"chmod 0\" or \"chown root\" and \"chmod 700\" to prevent authentication with ssh keys etc",
