An attacker, able to inject NULL bytes in a path, could possibly trigger an unspecified behavior of the ruby script.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of ruby as shipped with Red Hat CloudForms 4. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having security impact of Moderate. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n\nThis issue affects the versions of ruby as shipped with Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having security impact of Moderate. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n            MITIGATION: It is possible to test for presence of the NULL byte manually prior to call a Dir method with an untrusted string.",
