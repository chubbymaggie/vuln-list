An attacker, able to control the unpack format, could use this flaw to disclose arbitrary parts of the application's memory.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of ruby as shipped with Red Hat CloudForms 4. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having security impact of Moderate. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n\nThis issue affects the versions of ruby as shipped with Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having security impact of Moderate. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n            MITIGATION: Vulnerable code when String#unpack's argument is attacker controlled.\nIn the unpack format string argemument, manual sanitization can be done by preventing the number following '@' to overflow to a negative number.
