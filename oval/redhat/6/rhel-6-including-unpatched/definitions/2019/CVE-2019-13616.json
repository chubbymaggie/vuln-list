    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in SDL in the SDL_BlitCopy() function, that was called while copying an existing surface into a new optimized one, due to lack of validation while loading a BMP image in the SDL_LoadBMP_RW() function. An application that uses SDL to parse untrusted input files may be vulnerable to this flaw, which could allow an attacker to make the application crash or possibly execute code.\n            \n            MITIGATION: If the application accepts untrusted BMP files there is no known mitigation apart from applying the patch.",
