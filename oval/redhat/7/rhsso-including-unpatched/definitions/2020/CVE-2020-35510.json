    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in JBoss Remoting in all versions up to, and including 5.0.20.Final. When a malicious attacker could cause threads holding up forever in the EJB server by writing a sequence of bytes corresponding to the expected messages of a successful EJB client request, but omitting the ack messages, or just tamper with jboss-remoting code, deleting the lines that send the ack message from the EJB client code resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
