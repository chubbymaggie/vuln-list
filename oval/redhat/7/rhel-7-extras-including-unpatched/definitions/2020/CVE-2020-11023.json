    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in jQuery in versions beginning in 1.0.3 through 3.5.0. HTML containing \u003coption\u003e elements from untrusted sources are passed, even after sanitizing, to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods which may execute untrusted code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6, 7 and 8 ship a vulnerable version of JQuery in the `pcs` component. However the vulnerable has not been found to be exploitable in reasonable scenarios. A future update may update JQuery to a fixed version.",
