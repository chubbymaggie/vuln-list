    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An integer underflow has been discovered in strongSwan VPN's charon server, which could lead to a buffer overflow and consequent crash. A local attacker, with enough privileges to access the Unix Domain Socket /var/run/charon.ctl, could use this vulnerability to crash the charon server.\n            \n            MITIGATION: On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 only root has access to /var/run/charon.ctl so you need to be already root to exploit the vulnerability.",
