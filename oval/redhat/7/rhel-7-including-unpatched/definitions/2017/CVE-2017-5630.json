    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in php-pear where if a malicious server responded to a pear\n            STATEMENT: Since pear's purpose is to download libraries for inclusion in an application, any use of `pear install` or `pear download` implicitly trusts the server. This vulnerability does not significantly extend the trust already given to pear and to servers used with it.\n            MITIGATION: This vulnerability only allows files in the current directory to be overwritten, so using `pear download` in a temporary directory effectively mitigates the risk of a dangerous file overwrite occurring.",
