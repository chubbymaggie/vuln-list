    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An infinite loop issue was found to occur in the e1000e NIC emulation code of QEMU. It could occur in the e1000e_write_packet_to_guest() routine while processing bogus RX descriptor data transmitted by the guest. A privileged guest user could exploit this issue to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.\n            STATEMENT: This flaw did not affect the versions of `qemu-kvm` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, as they did not include support for e1000e NIC emulation.",
