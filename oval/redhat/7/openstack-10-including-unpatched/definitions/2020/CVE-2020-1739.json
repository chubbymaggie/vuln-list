    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Ansible Engine. When a password is set with the argument \"password\" of svn module, it is used on svn command line, disclosing to other users within the same node. An attacker could take advantage by reading the cmdline file from that particular PID on the procfs.\n            STATEMENT: Ansible Engine 2.7.16, 2.8.10, and 2.9.6 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nAnsible Tower 3.4.5, 3.5.5 and 3.6.3 as well as previous versions are affected.\n            MITIGATION: Instead of using the parameter 'password' of the subversion module, provide the password with stdin.",
