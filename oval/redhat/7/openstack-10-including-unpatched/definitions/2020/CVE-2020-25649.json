    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in FasterXML Jackson Databind which did not have entity expansion secured properly making it vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE). The primary threat from this flaw is data integrity.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Virtualization ships vulnerable version of jackson-databind, however the vulnerable DOMDeserializer class is not used in the code, therefore reducing impact to low. Likewise, a vulnerable version of jackson-databind is shipped in the pki-deps:10.6 module of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. pki-deps:10.6 is for pki-core dependencies, but pki-core does not use the vulnerable DOMDeserializer class and thus has been set to low impact. Future updates may include fixed version of jackson-databind.\nIn addition, Red Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.",
