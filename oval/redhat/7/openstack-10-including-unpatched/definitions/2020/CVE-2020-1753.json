    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A security flaw was found in the Ansible Engine when managing Kubernetes using the k8s connection plugin. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to the kubectl command line instead of using environment variables or an input configuration file, which is safer. This flaw discloses passwords and tokens from the process list, and the no_log directive from the debug module would not be reflected in the underlying command-line tools options, displaying passwords and tokens on stdout and log files.\n            STATEMENT: Ansible Engine 2.7.17, 2.8.10, and 2.9.6 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nAnsible Tower 3.4.5, 3.5.5 and 3.6.3 as well as previous versions are affected.\n            MITIGATION: Currently, there is no mitigation for this issue.",
