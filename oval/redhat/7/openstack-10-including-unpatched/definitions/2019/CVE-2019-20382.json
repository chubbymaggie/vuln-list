    ],
    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A memory leakage flaw was found in the way the VNC display driver of QEMU handled the connection disconnect when ZRLE and Tight encoding are enabled. Two VncState objects are created, and one allocates memory for the Zlib's data object. This allocated memory is not freed upon disconnection, resulting in a memory leak. An attacker able to connect to the VNC server could use this flaw to leak host memory,  leading to a potential denial of service.\n            STATEMENT: This flaw did not affect the versions of `qemu-kvm` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as they did not include the vulnerable code.",
