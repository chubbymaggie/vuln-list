    "Description": "STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) includes a builtin externalIP admission plugin, which restricts the use of Service eternalIPs to those configured by a cluster-admin. In OCP4 all externalIP ranges are disabled by default. In OCP 3.11, the default range is \"0.0.0.0/0\", which allows all IP addresses.\n\nThe second attack vector, via patching the Status of a LoadBalancer Service, is not possible unless permission to patch service/status is granted. OCP does not grant this permission to users who are not cluster-admins.\n\nOCP 4 is not affected by this vulnerability as it is secure by default. OCP 3.11 is affected, however the vulnerability can be by mitigated by configuring the builtin externalIP admission plugin.\n            MITIGATION: ExternalIP addresses ranges can be configured as described below. OCP 4 is secure by default, though cluster-admins can whitelist externalIP addresses as needed. OCP 3.11 can be secured by changing `externalIPNetworkCIDR` to \"0.0.0.0/32\", which blocks all externalIP address values.\n\nhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/networking/configuring_ingress_cluster_traffic/configuring-externalip.html\nhttps://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/tcp_ingress_external_ports.html#service-externalip\n\nUsers can check if they have permission to patch the Status of a LoadBalancer Service with the command: `kubectl auth can-i patch service --subresource=status`. In OCP, by default only cluster-admins are granted this permission.",
