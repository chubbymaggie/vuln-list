    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Jenkins Pipeline. In the Declarative plugin, the script sandbox protection could be circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST. Both the pipeline validation REST APIs and the actual script/pipeline execution are affected. This allows users with Overall/Read permissions, or those able to control Jenkinsfile or the sandboxed Pipeline shared library contents in SCM, to bypass sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",
