    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the way Varnish parsed certain HTTP/1 requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash Varnish by sending specially crafted multiple HTTP/1 requests processed on the same HTTP/1 keep-alive connection. This causes Varnish to restart with a clean cache, causing a denial of service.\n            STATEMENT: This is a remote denial of service flaw in varnish cache application. It causes varnish to restart, with a clean cache, since the purpose of varnish is to cache web pages thereby improving overall web server performance, an attacker can cause web performance to degrade due to this attack.\n            MITIGATION: This flaw can be mitigated by using making changes in varnish configuration by using VCL (Varnish Configuration Language).
