    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered in bootstrap. If an attacker could control the data given to tooltip or popover, they could inject HTML or Javascript into the rendered page when tooltip or popover events fired.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat CloudForms 4.6 and newer versions include the vulnerable component, but there is no risk of exploitation since there is no possible vector to access the vulnerability. Older Red Hat CloudForms versions don't use the vulnerable component at all.",
