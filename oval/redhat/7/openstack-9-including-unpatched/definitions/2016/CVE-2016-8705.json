    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the memcached binary protocol. An attacker could create a specially crafted message that would cause the memcached server to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.\n            STATEMENT: The versions of memcached as shipped with Red Hat OpenStack Platform 7, 8 and 9 are affected by this issue however will not be updated. The latest version of memcached from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 can safely be allowed to supersede the earlier versions provided in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform channels.\n            MITIGATION: This flaw is in the memcached binary protocol. If your client programs only use the ASCII protocol when communicating with memcached, you can disable the binary protocol and protect against this flaw by adding \"-B ascii\" to OPTIONS in /etc/sysconfig/memcached.",
