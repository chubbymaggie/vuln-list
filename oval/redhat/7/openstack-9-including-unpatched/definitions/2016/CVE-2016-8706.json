    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in memcached's parsing of SASL authentication messages. An attacker could create a specially crafted message that would cause the memcached server to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.\n            STATEMENT: The version of memcached as shipped with Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9 is affected by this issue however will not be updated. The latest version of memcached from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 can safely be allowed to supersede the earlier versions provided in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform channels.\n            MITIGATION: This flaw requires memcached to be running with SASL authentication enabled, which is not the default setting. If your memcached instances are running without the \"-S\" command-line option, they are not vulnerable.",
