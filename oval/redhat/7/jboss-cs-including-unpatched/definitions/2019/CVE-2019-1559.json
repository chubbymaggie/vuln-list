    "Description": "STATEMENT: 1 For this issue to be exploitable, the (server) application using the OpenSSL library needs to use it incorrectly.\n2. There are multiple other requirements for the attack to succeed: \n    - The ciphersuite used must be obsolete CBC cipher without a stitched implementation (or the system be in FIPS mode)\n    - the attacker has to be a MITM\n    - the attacker has to be able to control the client side to send requests to the buggy server on demand\n            MITIGATION: As a workaround you can disable SHA384 if applications (compiled with OpenSSL) allow for adjustment of the ciphersuite string configuration.",
