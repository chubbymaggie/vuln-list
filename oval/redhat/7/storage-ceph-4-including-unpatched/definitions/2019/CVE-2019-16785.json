    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An HTTP-request vulnerability was discovered in Waitress which implemented a \"MAY\" part of the RFC7230 which states: \"Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\" Unfortunately, if a front-end server does not process header fields with an LF the same way as it processes those with a CRLF, it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server processing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This vulnerability can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling and splitting where Waitress may see two requests, while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message.\n            STATEMENT: All affected Red Hat products ship but do not use the flawed version of python-waitress. The impact for these products is therefore rated as having a security impact of Low.",
