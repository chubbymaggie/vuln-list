    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability in Ansible's nxos_file_copy module can be used to copy files to a flash or bootflash on NXOS devices. Malicious code could craft the filename parameter to perform OS command injections. This could result in a loss of confidentiality of the system among other issues.\n            STATEMENT: Ansible Engine 2.7.15, 2.8.7, and 2.9.2 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nRed Hat Gluster Storage 3 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 no longer maintain their own version of Ansible. Therefore this fix will be consumed directly from core Ansible.\n            MITIGATION: There is no mitigation for this issue, the flaw can only be resolved by applying updates.",
