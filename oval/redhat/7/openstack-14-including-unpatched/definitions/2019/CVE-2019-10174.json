    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in Infinispan such that the invokeAccessibly method from the public class ReflectionUtil allows any application class to invoke private methods in any class with Infinispan's privileges. The attacker can use reflection to introduce new, malicious behavior into the application.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack Platform's OpenDaylight contains the vulnerable library. This library is a requirement of other dependencies (Karaf and Hibernate). Under supported deployments, the vulnerable functionality is not utilized. Based on this, no OpenDaylight versions will not be fixed.\n            MITIGATION: There is no known mitigation for this issue.",
