    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An Improper Output Neutralization for Logs flaw was found in Ansible when using the uri module, where sensitive data is exposed to content and json output. This flaw allows an attacker to access the logs or outputs of performed tasks to read keys used in playbooks from other users within the uri module. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 ships the affected version of Ansible, but they no longer maintain their own version of Ansible. Both the products will consume fixes directly from the Ansible repository. As we still ship Ansible separately for Ceph on Ubuntu, a future update may address this issue.\n\nThe impact of this flaw on Red Hat Open Stack Platform 13 is rated low because Ansible is used exclusively by Director - implying that there are no user playbooks from which sensitive URI passwords could be leaked. Red Hat Open Stack Platform 15 and newer consume fixes directly from the Ansible repository.\n            MITIGATION: There is no mitigation for this issue.",
