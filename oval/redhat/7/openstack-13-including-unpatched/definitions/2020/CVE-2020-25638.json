    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in hibernate-core in versions prior to and including 5.4.23.Final. A SQL injection in the implementation of the JPA Criteria API can permit unsanitized literals when a literal is used in the SQL comments of the query. This flaw could allow an attacker to access unauthorized information or possibly conduct further attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n            \n            MITIGATION: Set hibernate.use_sql_comments to false, which is the default value, or use named parameters instead of literals. Please refer to details in https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#configurations-logging and https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#sql-query-parameters.",
