    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Apache Karaf XMLInputFactory, where it does not prevent External Entity Processing (XXE). This is a potential security risk as an attacker could inject external XML entities to access sensitive information or conduct further attacks.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack Platform: Karaf is used by RHOSP's OpenDaylight, and this flaw impacts the loading of XML documents within Karaf, allowing arbitrary XML to be injected into parsed documents. The impact of this vulnerability is reduced in OpenDaylight, given karaf is an administrative component and not normally exposed to public networks or non-privileged users, and therefore will not be fixed at this time.\n\nFuse 7:\nThe impact of this vulnerability is reduced, as exploiting it would require a authenticated user, and no unsecured endpoints are exposed to the network",
