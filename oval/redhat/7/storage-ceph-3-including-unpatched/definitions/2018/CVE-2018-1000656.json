    "Description": "STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of python-flask as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nAlthough Red Hat Satellite 6 contains the vulnerable component, the former is not affected due to python-flask only receiving JSON data created by other Red Hat Satellite 6 components, not user-controlled JSON data, which makes the attack unfeasible.",
