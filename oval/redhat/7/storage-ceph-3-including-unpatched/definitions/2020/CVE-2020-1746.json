    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine when the ldap_attr and ldap_entry community modules are used. The issue discloses the LDAP bind password to stdout or a log file if a playbook task is written using the bind_pw in the parameters field. The highest threat from this vulnerability is data confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: * Ansible Engine 2.7.16, 2.8.10, and 2.9.6 as well as previous versions are affected.\n* Ansible Tower 3.4.5, 3.5.5 and 3.6.3 as well as previous versions are affected.\n* Red Hat Gluster Storage and Red Hat Ceph Storage no longer maintains their own version of Ansible. The fix will be provided from core Ansible. But we still ship ansible separately for ceph ubuntu.\n            MITIGATION: Using args keyword and embedding the ldap_auth variable instead of using bind_pw parameter would mitigate this issue.",
