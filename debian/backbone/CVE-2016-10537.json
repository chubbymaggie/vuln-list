  "description": "backbone is a module that adds in structure to a JavaScript heavy application through key-value pairs and custom events connecting to your RESTful API through JSON There exists a potential Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in the `Model#Escape` function of backbone 0.3.3 and earlier, if a user is able to supply input. This is due to the regex that's replacing things to miss the conversion of things such as `\u003c` to `\u003c`.",
