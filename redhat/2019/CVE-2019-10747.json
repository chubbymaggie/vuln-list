Similar issue about prototype pollution [1] have been fixed, but no known attack vector was found, so we're rating this issue as Low for OCP. \nIn Red Hat Software Collections and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, nodejs-set-value is bundled into nodejs-nodemon, and is not meant to be accessed outside of that package. Within nodemon, this flaw is rated with a Low severity.\n[1] CVE-2019-10744 https://www.elastic.co/community/security",
