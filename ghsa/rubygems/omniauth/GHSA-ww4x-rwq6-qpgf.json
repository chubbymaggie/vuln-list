    "Description": "The request phase of the OmniAuth Ruby gem is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery when used as part of the Ruby on Rails framework, allowing accounts to be connected without user intent, user interaction, or feedback to the user. This permits a secondary account to be able to sign into the web application as the primary account.\n\nThere is currently no fixed version of this package, however there is a recommended remediation described [here](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284).",
