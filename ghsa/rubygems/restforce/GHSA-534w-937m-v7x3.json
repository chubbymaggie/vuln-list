    "Description": "A flaw in how restforce constructs URLs may allow an attacker to inject additional parameters into Salesforce API requests.   \n\nImpact\n------\nThis flaw is only exploitable in applications that pass user input directly to restforce's select, find, describe, update, upsert, and destroy methods.\n\nVulnerable code might look like:\n```ruby\n  client.select('SomeSalesForceObject', params[:some-id],\n     ...)\n```\n\nIn such an application, attackers could pass `0016000000MRatd/describe`  as a request parameter, causing the server to make a request to a different endpoint than the server is designed to handle. Since the Salesforce REST API supports overriding HTTP methods via a request parameter, an attacker could also cause the client's `select()` method to modify data, by passing `0016000000MRatd/?_HttpMethod=PATCH\u0026other-query-params=...`.\n\nWorkarounds\n------\nIf possible, applications should track salesforce IDs internally, rather than passing user-supplied IDs to salesforce. Such practice mitigates this vulnerability, and in general is desirable for ensuring strong access control.",
