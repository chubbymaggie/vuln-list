    "Description": "Versions of `openpgp` prior to 4.2.0 are vulnerable to Message Signature Bypass. The package fails to verify that a message signature is of type `text`. This allows an attacker to to construct a message with a signature type that only verifies subpackets without additional input (such as `standalone` or `timestamp`). For example, an attacker that captures a `standalone` signature packet from a victim can construct arbitrary signed messages that would be verified correctly.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 4.2.0 or later.\nIf you are upgrading from a version \u003c4.0.0 it is highly recommended to read the `High-Level API Changes` section of the `openpgp` 4.0.0 release: https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/releases/tag/v4.0.0",
