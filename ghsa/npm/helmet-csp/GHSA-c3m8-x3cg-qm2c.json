    "Description": "Versions of `helmet-csp` before to 2.9.1 are vulnerable to a Configuration Override affecting the application's Content Security Policy (CSP). The package's browser sniffing for Firefox deletes the `default-src` CSP policy, which is the fallback policy. This allows an attacker to remove an application's default CSP, possibly rendering the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 2.9.1 or later. Setting the `browserSniff` configuration to `false` in vulnerable versions also mitigates the issue.",
