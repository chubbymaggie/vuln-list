    "Description": "Versions of `express-basic-auth` prior to 1.2.0 are vulnerable to Timing Attacks. The package uses nating string comparison instead of a constant time string compare which may lead to Timing Attacks. Timing Attacks can be used to increase the efficiency of brute-force attacks by removing the exponential increase in entropy gained from longer secrets.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.2.0 or later.",
