    "Description": "Versions of `angular ` prior to 1.7.9 are vulnerable to prototype pollution. The deprecated API function `merge()` does not restrict the modification of an Object's prototype in the , which may allow an attacker to add or modify an existing property that will exist on all objects.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.7.9 or later. The function was already deprecated and upgrades are not expected to break functionality.",
