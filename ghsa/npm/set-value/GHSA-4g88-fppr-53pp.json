    "Description": "Versions of `set-value` prior to 3.0.1 or 2.0.1 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The `set` function fails to validate which Object properties it updates. This allows attackers to modify the prototype of Object, causing the addition or modification of an existing property on all objects.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIf you are using `set-value` 3.x, upgrade to version 3.0.1 or later.\nIf you are using `set-value` 2.x, upgrade to version 2.0.1 or later.\n",
