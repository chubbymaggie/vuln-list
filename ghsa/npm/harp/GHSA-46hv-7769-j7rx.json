    "Description": "All versions of `harp` are vulnerable to Unauthorized File Access. The package states that it ignores files and directories with names that start with an underscore, such as `_secret-folder`. If the underscore character is URL encoded the server delivers the file.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.",
