    "Description": "Versions of `shave` prior to 2.5.3 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The `shave` package overwrites HTML elements and in doing so fails to properly encode the output. If encoded HTML input is passed into `shave` the output will be decoded which may lead to Cross-Site Scripting.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 2.5.3 or later.",
