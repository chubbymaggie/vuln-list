    "Description": "All versions of `status-board` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The `renderJsDashboard()` function concatenates the `safeDashboard` variable to the HTTP response message with insufficient sanitization. If this variable is controlled by user input it may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
