    "Description": "Versions of `cryptiles` prior to 4.1.2 are vulnerable to Insufficient Entropy. The `randomDigits()` method does not provide sufficient entropy and its generates digits that are not evenly distributed.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 4.1.2. The package is deprecated and has been moved to `@hapi/cryptiles` and it is strongly recommended to use the maintained package.",
