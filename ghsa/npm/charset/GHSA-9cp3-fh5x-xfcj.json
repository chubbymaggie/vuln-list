    "Description": "Affected versions of `charset` are susceptible to a regular expression denial of service.\n\nThe amplification on this vulnerability is relatively low - it takes around 2 seconds for the engine to execute on a malicious input which is 50,000 characters in length.\n\n\nIf node was compiled using the `-DHTTP_MAX_HEADER_SIZE` however, the impact of the vulnerability can be significant, as the primary limitation for the vulnerability is the default max HTTP header length in node.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.0.1 or later.",
