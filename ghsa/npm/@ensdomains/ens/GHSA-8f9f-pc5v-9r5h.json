    "Description": "### Impact\nA user who owns an ENS domain can set a \"trapdoor\", allowing them to transfer ownership to another user, and later regain ownership without the new owner's consent or awareness.\n\n### Patches\n\nA new ENS deployment is being rolled out that fixes this vulnerability in the ENS registry. The registry is newly deployed at [0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e).\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not accept transfers of ENS domains from other users on the old registrar.",
