    "Description": "Versions of `connect-pg-simple` are vulnerable to SQL Injection. The `PGStore.prototype.quotedTable` function allows for the query to be manipulated if the input has double quotes through the `schemaName` or `tableName` variables. These variables are passed to the constructor and are unlikely to be controlled by user-input. If they are controlled by user-input it could allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 6.0.1 or later.",
