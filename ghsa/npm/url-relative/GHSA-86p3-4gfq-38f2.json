    "Description": "All versions of `url-relative` are vulnerable to Denial of Service. If the values `to` and `from` are equal, the function hangs and never returns. This may cause a Denial of Service.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.",
