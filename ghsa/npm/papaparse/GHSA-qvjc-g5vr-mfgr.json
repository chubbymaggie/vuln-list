    "Description": "Versions of `papaparse` prior to 5.2.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDos). The `parse` function contains a malformed regular expression that takes exponentially longer to process non-numerical inputs. This allows attackers to stall systems and lead to Denial of Service.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 5.2.0 or later.",
