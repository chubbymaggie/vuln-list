    "Description": "Versions of `fstream` prior to 1.0.12 are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Overwrite. Extracting tarballs containing a hardlink to a file that already exists in the system and a file that matches the hardlink will overwrite the system's file with the contents of the extracted file. The `fstream.DirWriter()` function is vulnerable.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.0.12 or later.",
