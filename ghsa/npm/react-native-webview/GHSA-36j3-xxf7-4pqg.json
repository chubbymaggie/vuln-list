    "Description": "A universal cross-site scripting (UXSS) vulnerability, CVE-2020-6506 (https://crbug.com/1083819), has been identified in the Android WebView system component, which allows cross-origin iframes to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the top-level document. This vulnerability affects React Native apps which use a `react-native-webview` that allows navigation to arbitrary URLs, and when that app runs on systems with an Android WebView version prior to 83.0.4103.106.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nreact-native-webview 11.0.0+ has introduced a new prop to mitigate this issue.  Updating to a later version is recommended.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://alesandroortiz.com/articles/uxss-android-webview-cve-2020-6506/",
