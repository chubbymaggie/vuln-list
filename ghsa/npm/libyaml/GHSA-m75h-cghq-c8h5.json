    "Description": "Versions 0.2.2 and earlier depend on native libyaml version 0.1.5 or earlier. As such, they are affected by a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability that may result in a crash or arbitrary code execution when parsing YAML tags.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\n- Update to version 0.2.3 that includes a version of LibYAML that contains a fix for this issue.",
