    "Description": "Affected versions of `backbone` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting when users are allowed to supply input to the `Model#Escape` function, and the output is then written to the DOM. \n\nThe vulnerability occurs as a result of the regular expression used to encode metacharacters failing to take HTML Entities such as `\u0026#60;` into account.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.5.0 or later.",
