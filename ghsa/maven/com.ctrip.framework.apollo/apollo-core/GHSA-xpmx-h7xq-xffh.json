    "Description": "### Impact\nIf users expose apollo-adminservice to internet(which is not recommended), there are potential security issues since apollo-adminservice is designed to work in intranet and it doesn't have built-in access control. Malicious hackers may access apollo-adminservice apis directly to access/edit the application's configurations.\n\n### Patches\nAccess control for admin service was added in #3233 and was released in [v1.7.1](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/releases/tag/v1.7.1).\n\n### Workarounds\nTo fix the potential issue without upgrading, simply follow the advice that do not expose apollo-adminservice to internet.\n\n### References\n[Apollo Security Guidence](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/wiki/Apollo%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97#71-%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9B%B8%E5%85%B3)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an [issue](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/issues)\n* Email to one of the active [project maintainers](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/graphs/contributors)",
