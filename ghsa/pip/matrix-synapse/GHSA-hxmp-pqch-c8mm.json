    "Description": "### Impact\n\nA malicious or poorly-implemented homeserver can inject malformed events into a room by specifying a different room id in the path of a `/send_join`, `/send_leave`, `/invite` or `/exchange_third_party_invite` request.\n\nThis can lead to a denial of service in which future events will not be correctly sent to other servers over federation.\n\nThis affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers.\n\n### Patches\n\nIssue is resolved by https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8776.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nHomeserver administrators could limit access to the federation API to trusted servers (for example via `federation_domain_whitelist`).",
