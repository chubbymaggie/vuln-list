    "Description": "### Impact\nThe cache action in action/cache.py allows directory traversal through a crafted HTTP request. An attacker who can upload attachments to\nthe wiki can use this to achieve remote code execution.\n\n### Patches\nUsers are strongly advised to upgrade to a patched version.\n\nMoinMoin Wiki 1.9.11 has the necessary fixes and also contains other important fixes.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt is not advised to work around this, but to upgrade MoinMoin to a patched version.\n\nThat said, a work around via disabling the `cache` or the `AttachFile` action might be possible.\n\nAlso, it is of course helpful if you give `write` permissions (which include uploading attachments) only to trusted users.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by Michael Chapman.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email me at [twaldmann@thinkmo.de](mailto:twaldmann@thinkmo.de).",
