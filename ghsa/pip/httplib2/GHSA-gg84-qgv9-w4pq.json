    "Description": "### Impact\nAttacker controlling unescaped part of uri for `httplib2.Http.request()` could change request headers and body, send additional hidden requests to same server.\n\nImpacts software that uses httplib2 with uri constructed by string concatenation, as opposed to proper urllib building with escaping.\n\n### Patches\nProblem has been fixed in 0.18.0\nSpace, CR, LF characters are now quoted before any use.\nThis solution should not impact any valid usage of httplib2 library, that is uri constructed by urllib.\n\n### Workarounds\nCreate URI with `urllib.parse` family functions: `urlencode`, `urlunsplit`.\n\n```diff\nuser_input = \" HTTP/1.1\\r\\ninjected: attack\\r\\nignore-http:\"\n-uri = \"https://api.server/?q={}\".format(user_input)\n+uri = urllib.parse.urlunsplit((\"https\", \"api.server\", \"/v1\", urllib.parse.urlencode({\"q\": user_input}), \"\"))\nhttp.request(uri)\n```\n\n### References\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/93.html\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html\n\nThanks to Recar https://github.com/Ciyfly for finding vulnerability and discrete notification.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [httplib2](https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2/issues/new)\n* Email [current maintainer at 2020-05](mailto:temotor@gmail.com)",
