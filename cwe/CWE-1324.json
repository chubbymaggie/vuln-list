 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "On a debug configuration with a remote host,\n                    unbeknownst to the host/user, an attacker with physical\n                    access to a target system places a probing device on the\n                    debug interface or software related to the JTAG port e.g.\n                    device driver. While the authorized host/user performs\n                    sensitive operations to the target system, the attacker\n                    uses the probe to collect the JTAG traffic. \n                "
