  "\n\t\t\t  If the component is discovered to contain a vulnerability or critical bug, but the issue cannot be fixed using an update or patch, then the product's operator will not be able to protect against the issue.  This could leave the product open to attacker exploitation or critical operation failures.\n\t\t\t  ",
  "\n\t\t\t    While hardware can be prone to this weakness, software systems can also be affected, such as when a third-party driver or library is no longer actively maintained or supported but is still critical for the required functionality."
